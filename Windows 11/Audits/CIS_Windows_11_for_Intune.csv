Windows service for application access to downloaded maps. This service is started on-demand by application accessing downloaded maps.

Mapping technologies can unwillingly reveal your location to attackers and other software that picks up the information. In addition, automatic downloads of data from third-party sources should be minimized when not needed. Therefore, this service should not be needed in high security environments.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name MapsBroker -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Applications will be prevented from accessing maps data.

This setting determines whether applications and services on the device can utilize new consumer Microsoft account authentication via the Windows OnlineID and WebAccountManager APIs.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and maintain firm control of what accounts are used on their computers will probably want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Provides the ability to share a cellular data connection with another device.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

The capability to run a mobile hotspot from a domain-connected computer could easily expose the internal network to wardrivers or other hackers.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureWindowsMobileHotspotServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name icssvc -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The Windows Mobile Hotspot feature will not be available.

This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up the system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as NTBACKUP ) attempts to access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application programming interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions apply.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

Users who are able to back up data from a computer could take the backup media to a non-domain computer on which they have administrative privileges and restore the data. They could take ownership of the files and view any unencrypted data that is contained within the backup set.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Backup Files And Directories

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

Changes in the membership of the groups that have the Back up files and directories user right could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that authorized backup administrators are still able to perform backup operations.

This policy setting specifies a text message that displays to users when they log on. Set the following group policy to a value that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.

Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happens. It may also help to reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the logon process. This text is often used for legal reasons - for example, to warn users about the ramifications of misusing company information or to warn them that their actions may be audited.

Note: Any warning that you display should first be approved by your organization's legal and human resources representatives.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to a value that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization:

Local Policies Security Options\Interactive logon: Message text for users attempting to log on

Impact:

Users will have to acknowledge a dialog box containing the configured text before they can log on to the computer.

Note: Windows Vista and Windows XP Professional support logon banners that can exceed 512 characters in length and that can also contain carriage-return line-feed sequences. However, Windows 2000-based clients cannot interpret and display these messages. You must use a Windows 2000-based computer to create a logon message policy that applies to Windows 2000-based computers.

Warning:

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

Device drivers run as highly privileged code. A user who has the Load and unload device drivers user right could unintentionally install malicious code that masquerades as a device driver. Administrators should exercise greater care and install only drivers with verified digital signatures.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Load Unload Device Drivers

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you remove the Load and unload device drivers user right from the Print Operators group or other accounts you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should ensure that delegated tasks will not be negatively affected.

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the 'Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM' check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

Note #2: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require additional authentication at startup

Impact:

A PIN requires physical presence to restart the computer. This functionality is not compatible with Wake on LAN solutions.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Backup recovery passwords and key packages

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Backup recovery passwords and key packages

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered: Configure storage of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS:

Impact:

None - this value is ignored when the checkbox above it (

Save BitLocker recovery information to AD DS for fixed data drives

) is False (unchecked). If that checkbox is set to True (checked), both recovery passwords and key packages for fixed drives will be saved to AD DS.

This subcategory reports when a user logs off from the system. These events occur on the accessed computer. For interactive logons, the generation of these events occurs on the computer that is logged on to. If a network logon takes place to access a share, these events generate on the computer that hosts the accessed resource. If you configure this setting to No auditing, it is difficult or impossible to determine which user has accessed or attempted to access organization computers. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4634: An account was logged off.
 - 4647: User initiated logoff.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Auditing\Account Logon Logoff Audit Logoff

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting determines whether the all Windows Spotlight features are turned on/off (together).

The recommended state for this setting is: Block

Note:

Per Microsoft TechNet

, this policy setting only applies to Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education editions.

Note #2: Setting this recommendation to Block also disables the Recommendation Allow Tailored Experiences With Diagnostic Data which was is included in the on-prem Workstation Benchmarks. It was not included in the Intune version since this setting is automatically disabled.

Disabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display suggested apps as well as images from the internet.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Block :

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of device setup class globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for device drivers that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing or updating device drivers whose device setup class GUIDs appear in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: True (checked)

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:

Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled and check the Also apply to matching devices that are already installed. button.

Allows UPnP devices to be hosted on this computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Universal Plug n Play (UPnP) is a real security risk - it allows automatic discovery and attachment to network devices. Notes that UPnP is different than regular Plug n Play (PnP). Workstations should not be advertising their services (or automatically discovering and connecting to networked services) in a security-conscious enterprise managed environment.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureUPnPDeviceHostServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name upnphost -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Any hosted UPnP devices will stop functioning and no additional hosted devices can be added.

The built-in local guest account is another well-known name to attackers. It is recommended to rename this account to something that does not indicate its purpose. Even if you disable this account, which is recommended, ensure that you rename it for added security.

The Guest account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path:

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The 'Allow certificate-based data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: False

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: False

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Allow data recovery agent

Impact:

A Data Recovery Agent will not be permitted for the operating system drive. Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

This policy setting controls whether the Print Spooler service will accept client connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: The Print Spooler service must be restarted for changes to this policy to take effect.

Disabling the ability for the Print Spooler service to accept client connections mitigates remote attacks against the PrintNightmare vulnerability (

CVE-2021-34527

) and other remote Print Spooler attacks. However, this recommendation

does not

mitigate against local attacks on the Print Spooler service.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\Printers\Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections

Impact:

Provided that the Print Spooler service is not disabled, users will continue to be able to print

from their workstation

. However, the workstation's Print Spooler service will not accept client connections or allow users to share printers. Note that all printers that were already shared will continue to be shared.

This setting is separate from the Welcome screen feature in Windows XP and Windows Vista; if that feature is disabled, this setting is not disabled. If you configure a computer for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also gain access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks to which the computer is connected. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is stored in the registry in plaintext, and the specific registry key that stores this value is remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group.

For additional information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 324737:

How to turn on automatic logon in Windows

.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

If you configure a computer for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also gain access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks that the computer is connected to. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is stored in the registry in plaintext. The specific registry key that stores this setting is remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group. As a result, this entry is appropriate only if the computer is physically secured and if you ensure that untrusted users cannot remotely see the registry.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to `Disabled.

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (AutoAdminLogon) Enable Automatic Logon (not recommended)

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

Warning:

The DLL search order can be configured to search for DLLs that are requested by running processes in one of two ways:

 - Search folders specified in the system path first, and then search the current working folder.
 - Search current working folder first, and then search the folders specified in the system path.

When enabled, the registry value is set to 1 With a setting of 1 the system first searches the folders that are specified in the system path and then searches the current working folder. When disabled the registry value is set to 0 and the system first searches the current working folder and then searches the folders that are specified in the system path.

Applications will be forced to search for DLLs in the system path first. For applications that require unique versions of these DLLs that are included with the application, this entry could cause performance or stability problems.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: More information on how Safe DLL search mode works is available at this link:

Dynamic-Link Library Search Order - Windows applications | Microsoft Docs

If a user unknowingly executes hostile code that was packaged with additional files that include modified versions of system DLLs, the hostile code could load its own versions of those DLLs and potentially increase the type and degree of damage the code can render.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode (recommended)

Impact:

Provides Web connectivity and administration through the Internet Information Services Manager.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

Internet Information Services - World Wide Web Services

).

Note #2: An organization may choose to selectively grant exceptions to web developers to allow IIS (or another web server) on their workstation, in order for them to locally test &amp; develop web pages. However, the organization should track those machines and ensure the security controls and mitigations are kept up to date, to reduce risk of compromise.

Hosting a website from a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.

Note: This security concern applies to

any

web server application installed on a workstation, not just IIS.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureWorldWideWebPublishingServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name W3SVC -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

IIS Web Services will not function.

This policy setting allows you to audit when plug and play detects an external device.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Note: A Windows 10, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.

Enabling this setting will allow a user to audit events when a device is plugged into a system. This can help alert IT staff if unapproved devices are plugged in.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Auditing\Detailed Tracking Audit PNP Activity

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console).

The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.

The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path:

Local Policies Security Options\Accounts: Rename administrator account

Impact:

You will have to inform users who are authorized to use this account of the new account name. (The guidance for this setting assumes that the Administrator account was not disabled, which was recommended earlier in this chapter.)

Maintains an updated list of computers on the network and supplies this list to computers designated as browsers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: In Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, this service is bundled with the

SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support

optional feature. As a result, removing that feature (highly recommended unless backward compatibility is needed to XP/2003 and older Windows OSes - see

Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft

) will also remediate this recommendation. The feature is not installed by default starting with Windows 10 R1709.

This is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their network shares in the environment (i.e. 'Network Neighborhood'). If enabled, it generates a lot of unnecessary traffic, including 'elections' to see who gets to be the 'master browser'. This noisy traffic could also aid malicious attackers in discovering online machines, because the service also allows anyone to 'browse' for shared resources without any authentication. This service used to be running by default in older Windows versions (e.g. Windows XP), but today it only remains for backward compatibility for very old software that requires it.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureComputerBrowserServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell, by running the following cmdlet:

if(Test-Path -LiteralPath 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser') {
    Set-ItemProperty -LiteralPath 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser' -Name 'Start' -Value 4 -Verbose
}

Note: This service is not installed in Windows 10 R1709 and newer. Running the cmdlet Set-Service -Name 'Browser' -StartupType Disabled will cause a inadvertent match against a similarly named service called bowser which coincidentally has the DisplayName of Browser and will then throw an error. bowser is actually the NT Lan Manager Datagram Receiver Driver Using the literal registry path above avoids that error.

Impact:

The list of computers and their shares on the network will not be updated or maintained.

Discovers networked devices and services that use the SSDP discovery protocol, such as UPnP devices. Also announces SSDP devices and services running on the local computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Universal Plug n Play (UPnP) is a real security risk - it allows automatic discovery and attachment to network devices. Note that UPnP is different than regular Plug n Play (PnP). Workstations should not be advertising their services (or automatically discovering and connecting to networked services) in a security-conscious enterprise managed environment.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 :

This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled. Virtualization Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enable virtualization based security

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at

Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enable virtualization based security :

Device Guard\Enable Virtualization Based Security

Impact:

Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known to be compatible.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: If this policy setting is disabled, the Security Center notifies you that the overall security of the operating system has been reduced.

This is the setting that turns on or off UAC. If this setting is disabled, UAC will not be used and any security benefits and risk mitigations that are dependent on UAC will not be present on the system.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Supports file, print, and named-pipe sharing over the network for this computer. If this service is stopped, these functions will be unavailable.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In a high security environment, a secure workstation should only be a

client

, not a server. Sharing workstation resources for remote access increases security risk as the attack surface is notably higher.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name LanmanServer -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

File, print and named-pipe sharing functions will be unavailable from this machine over the network.

Note: Many remote administration tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), require the Server service to be operational for remote management. In addition, many vulnerability scanners use this service to scan the file system remotely.

This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific security layer to secure communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: SSL

Note: In spite of this setting being labeled

SSL

, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.

The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all RDP communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: SSL

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections

Impact:

TLS 1.0 will be required to authenticate to the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not supported, the connection fails.

Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the

Server authentication certificate template

setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have 'Client Authentication' configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work.

Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a 'double logon' requirement for each and every new RDP session.

This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:

 - Good : The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.
 - Bad : The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do not allow known bad drivers to be initialized.
 - Bad, but required for boot : The driver has been identified as malware, but the computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.
 - Unknown : This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.

If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started.

If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical

This policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already infected your system.

This policy setting allows a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. If this user right is assigned, significant degradation of system performance can occur.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

Users with the Lock pages in memory user right could assign physical memory to several processes, which could leave little or no RAM for other processes and result in a DoS condition.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which equals No One

This policy setting allows the auditing of incoming NTLM traffic. Events for this setting are recorded in the operational event log (e.g. Applications and Services Log\Microsoft\Windows\NTLM).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enable auditing for all accounts

Auditing and monitoring NTLM traffic can assist in identifying systems using this outdated authentication protocol, so they can be remediated to using a more secure protocol, such as Kerberos. The log information gathered can also assist in forensic investigations after a malicious attack.

NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication is vulnerable to various attacks, including SMB relay, man-in-the-middle, and brute force attacks. Reducing and eliminating NTLM authentication in an environment reduces the risk of an attacker gaining access to systems on the network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enable auditing for all accounts :

Local Policies Security Options\Network security: Restrict NTLM: Audit Incoming NTLM Traffic

Impact:

The event log will contain information on incoming NTLM authentication traffic.

This policy setting denies access to the retail catalog in the Microsoft Store, but displays the private store.

The recommended state for this setting is: Only Private store is enabled

Allowing the private store will allow an organization to control the apps that users have access to add to a system. This will help ensure that unapproved malicious apps are not running on a system.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Only Private store is enabled :

Microsoft App Store\Require Private Store Only

Impact:

Users will not be able to view the retail catalog in the Microsoft Store, but they will be able to view apps in the private store.

"21156","","0.0","None","desktop-3gdcffv","tcp","0","Windows Compliance Checks","Compliance checks for Windows systems.","""74.10 (L1) Configure 'Create Symbolic Links': [PASSED]""

This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.

Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators and (when the

Hyper-V

feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines

Users who have the Create symbolic links user right could inadvertently or maliciously expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of Service attack.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators and (when the

Hyper-V

feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines

User Rights\Create Symbolic Links

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

In most cases there will be no impact because this is the default configuration. However, on Windows Workstations with the Hyper-V feature installed, this user right should also be granted to the special group NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines - otherwise you will not be able to create new virtual machines.

This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services or IIS also require this user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Users

Note: The Guest account is also assigned this user right by default. Although this account is disabled by default, it's recommended that you configure this setting through Group Policy. However, this user right should generally be restricted to the Administrators and Users groups. Assign this user right to the Backup Operators group if your organization requires that they have this capability.

Any account with the Allow log on locally user right can log on at the console of the computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to be able to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run malicious software to elevate their privileges.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators, Users

User Rights\Allow Local Log On

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you remove these default groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected by any changes that you make to the Allow log on locally user right.

This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. In an Intune managed environment this setting applies to local user accounts and not Entra ID accounts.

The value includes the user's current password. This value denotes that with a setting of 1, the user can't reuse their current password when choosing a new password, while a setting of 5 means that a user can't set their new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords.

The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s)

The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.

If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to 24 or more password(s) :

Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Device Password History

Impact:

The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess.

Warning: If an organization is using Windows Hello for Business the the Device Lock password settings can impact PIN polices if those policies are not first defined elsewhere. Windows will follow the Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs if this key exists: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork\<Tenant-ID>\Device\Policies Otherwise, it will follow Device Lock policies.

This benchmark recommends configuring Device Lock policies for Local User accounts and Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs.

This policy setting specifies whether to use the Store service for finding an application to open a file with an unhandled file type or protocol association. When a user opens a file type or protocol that is not associated with any applications on the computer, the user is given the choice to select a local application or use the Store service to find an application.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

The Store service is a retail outlet built into Windows, primarily for consumer use. In an enterprise managed environment the IT department should be managing the installation of all applications to reduce the risk of the installation of vulnerable software.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Internet Communication Management\Internet Communication settings\Turn off access to the Store

Impact:

The 'Look for an app in the Store' item in the Open With dialog is removed.

This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network, which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer. Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. This user right supersedes the Access Computer From Network user right if an account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests, Local account

Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) workstation as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the workstation.

Note: The security identifier Local account is not available in Windows 7 and Windows 8.0 unless

MSKB 2871997

has been installed.

Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared folders and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Guests, Local account

User Rights\Deny Access From Network

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you configure the Deny access to this computer from the network user right for other groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should verify that delegated tasks will not be negatively affected.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services', choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Store recovery passwords and key packages

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Store recovery passwords and key packages

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Configure storage of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS:

Impact:

Both the recovery password and the key package for the operating system drive will be saved to AD DS. Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes (4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 196,608 or greater

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 196,608 or greater

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Event Log Service\Security\Specify the maximum log file size (KB)

Impact:

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

Some versions of the CredSSP protocol that is used by some applications (such as Remote Desktop Connection) are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the client. This policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers and allows you to set the level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Force Updated Clients

This setting is important to mitigate the CredSSP encryption oracle vulnerability, for which information was published by Microsoft on 03/13/2018 in

CVE-2018-0886 | CredSSP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

. All versions of Windows from Windows Vista onwards are affected by this vulnerability, and will be compatible with this recommendation provided that they have been patched at least through May 2018 (or later).

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Force Updated Clients

Administrative Templates\System\Credentials Delegation\Encryption Oracle Remediation

Impact:

Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure versions and services using CredSSP will not accept unpatched clients. This setting should not be deployed until all remote hosts support the newest version, which is achieved by ensuring that all Microsoft security updates at least through May 2018 are installed.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The 'Allow certificate-based data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services', choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered

Impact:

Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enable

Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators.

It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enable :

This policy setting turns off the location feature for the computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

This setting affects the location feature (e.g. GPS or other location tracking). From a security perspective, it's not a good idea to reveal your location to software in most cases, but there are legitimate uses, such as mapping software. However, they should not be used in high security environments.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 0 :

This policy setting prevents computers from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to either the Internet or to a Windows domain.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3 = Prevent Wi-Fi when on Ethernet

Preventing bridged network connections can help prevent a user unknowingly allowing traffic to route between internal and external networks, which risks exposure to sensitive internal data.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 3 = Prevent Wi-Fi when on Ethernet

Administrative Templates\Network\Windows Connection Manager\Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows Domain

Impact:

While connected to an Ethernet connection, Windows won't allow use of a WLAN (automatically

or

manually) until Ethernet is disconnected. However, if a cellular data connection is available, it will always stay connected for services that require it, but no Internet traffic will be routed over cellular if an Ethernet or WLAN connection is present.

This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.

Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 730 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire.

Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.

The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0

The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to 365 or fewer days, but not 0 :

Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Device Password Expiration

Impact:

If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

Warning: If an organization is using Windows Hello for Business the the Device Lock password settings can impact PIN polices if those policies are not first defined elsewhere. Windows will follow the Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs if this key exists: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork\<Tenant-ID>\Device\Policies Otherwise, it will follow Device Lock policies.

This benchmark recommends configuring Device Lock policies for Local User accounts and Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs.

This option will only enable Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity on devices with UEFI firmware support for the Memory Attributes Table. Devices without the UEFI Memory Attributes Table may have firmware that is incompatible with Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity which in some cases can lead to crashes or data loss or incompatibility with certain plug-in cards. If not setting this option the targeted devices should be tested to ensure compatibility.

The recommended state for this setting is: Require UEFI Memory Attributes Table

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at

Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

This setting will help protect this control from being enabled on a system that is not compatible which could lead to a crash or data loss.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Require UEFI Memory Attributes Table

Virtualization Based Technology\Require UEFI Memory Attributes Table

Impact:

Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known to be compatible.

Warning #2 :

Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts

: This policy requires a reboot to apply. As a result, prompts may appear when modifying user account control (UAC) settings during the Out of the Box Experience (OOBE) using the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). Increased prompts are more likely if the device reboots after policies are applied. To work around this issue, the policies can be targeted to users instead of devices so that they apply later in the process. An exception to this recommendation may be needed if Windows AutoPilot is used.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not allow 256-bit recovery key

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Do not allow 256-bit recovery key

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Recovery Key

Impact:

A 256-bit recovery key will not be permitted for the operating system drive. Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

This policy setting allows you to control the redirection of supported Plug and Play devices, such as Windows Portable Devices, to the remote computer in a Remote Desktop Services session.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack surface. The need for Plug and Play device redirection within a Remote Desktop session is very rare, so makes sense to reduce the number of unexpected avenues for data exfiltration and/or malicious code transfer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Device and Resource Redirection\Do not allow supported Plug and Play device redirection

Impact:

Users in a Remote Desktop Services session will not be able to redirect their supported (local client) Plug and Play devices to the remote computer.

This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In an enterprise managed environment, only IT staff with administrative rights should be installing or changing software on a system. Allowing users the ability to have any control over installs can risk unapproved software from being installed or removed from a system, which could cause the system to become vulnerable to compromise.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled :

Microsoft App Store\MSI Allow user control over installs

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting controls whether the elevation request prompt is displayed on the interactive user's desktop or the secure desktop.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Standard elevation prompt dialog boxes can be spoofed, which may cause users to disclose their passwords to malicious software. The secure desktop presents a very distinct appearance when prompting for elevation, where the user desktop dims, and the elevation prompt UI is more prominent. This increases the likelihood that users who become accustomed to the secure desktop will recognize a spoofed elevation prompt dialog box and not fall for the trick.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a picture password.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: If the picture password feature is permitted, the user's domain password is cached in the system vault when using it.

Picture passwords bypass the requirement for a typed complex password. In a shared work environment, a simple shoulder surf where someone observed the on-screen gestures would allow that person to gain access to the system without the need to know the complex password. Vertical monitor screens with an image are much more visible at a distance than horizontal key strokes, increasing the likelihood of a successful observation of the mouse gestures.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Logon\Turn off picture password sign-in

Impact:

Users will not be able to set up or sign in with a picture password.

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This service runs in session 0 and hosts the notification platform and connection provider which handles the connection between the device and WNS server.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: In the first two releases of Windows 10 (R1507 &amp; R1511), the display name of this service was initially named

Windows Push Notifications Service

- but it was renamed to

Windows Push Notifications System Service

starting with Windows 10 R1607.

Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) is a mechanism to receive third-party notifications and updates from the cloud/Internet. In a high security environment, external systems, especially those hosted outside the organization, should be prevented from having an impact on the secure workstations.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name WpnService -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Live Tiles and other features will not get live updates.

This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By default, users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the computer by using the sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

If not properly configured, a user could accidentally share sensitive data with unauthorized users. In an enterprise managed environment, the company should provide a managed location for file sharing, such as a file server or SharePoint, instead of the user sharing files directly from their own user profile.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Network Sharing\Prevent users from sharing files within their profile. (User)

Impact:

Users cannot share files within their profile using the sharing wizard. Also, the sharing wizard cannot create a share at %root%\Users and can only be used to create SMB shares on folders.

This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.

The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.

With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.

When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

The recommended state for this setting is: Block

The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be managed centrally in most managed networks.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Block :

Local Policies Security Options\Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer

Impact:

None - this is the default configuration for domain-joined computers.

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service automatically listens on the network for requests on the HTTP transport over the default HTTP port.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service on trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\WinRM Service\Allow remote server management through WinRM

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named 'Administrator' because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista or newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:

 - If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.
 - If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.

Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Use Admin Approval Mode

Impact:

The built-in Administrator account uses Admin Approval Mode. Users that log on using the local Administrator account will be prompted for consent whenever a program requests an elevation in privilege, just like any other user would.

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of device setup class globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for device drivers that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing or updating device drivers whose device setup class GUIDs appear in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:

Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Device Installation\Device Installation Restrictions\Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes

Impact:

Devices matching the specified device setup classes will be prevented from installation.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Require 48-digit recovery password

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Require 48-digit recovery password

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Recovery Password

Impact:

A 48-digit recovery password will be required for the operating system drive. Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

Allows the redirection of Printers/Drives/Ports for RDP connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In a security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack surface - preventing the redirection of COM, LPT and PnP ports will reduce the number of unexpected avenues for data exfiltration and/or malicious code transfer within an RDP session.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name UmRdpService -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Printers, drives and ports (COM, LPT, PnP, etc.) will not be allowed to be redirected inside RDP sessions.

Enables multi-party communication using Peer-to-Peer Grouping.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Peer Name Resolution Protocol is a distributed and (mostly) serverless way to handle name resolution of clients with each other. In a high security environment, it is more secure to rely on centralized name resolution methods maintained by authorized staff.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name p2psvc -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Some applications, such as HomeGroup, may not function.

Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two options to help protect against this risk.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and how it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link:

Protect Remote Desktop credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Restricted Admin Mode

was designed to help protect administrator accounts by ensuring that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could potentially be compromised.

Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard

helps you protect your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos requests back to the device that is requesting the connection.Both features should be enabled and supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Credentials Delegation\Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials

Impact:

The host will support the

Restricted Admin Mode

and

Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard

features.

This policy setting determines which users can use tools to monitor the performance of non-system processes. Typically, you do not need to configure this user right to use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Performance snap-in. However, you do need this user right if System Monitor is configured to collect data using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Restricting the Profile single process user right prevents intruders from gaining additional information that could be used to mount an attack on the system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

The Profile single process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. An attacker with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes that they might wish to attack directly. The attacker may also be able to determine what processes run on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may need to avoid, such as antivirus software, an intrusion-detection system, or which other users are logged on to a computer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Profile single process

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

Use this option to specify the path and name of the file in which Windows Firewall will write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is: %SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\domainfw.log

If Windows Firewall events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible for Administrators to analyze system issues or unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Microsoft stores all firewall events as one file on the system ( pfirewall.log ). To improve logging, separate each firewall profile (domain, private, public) into its own distinct log file ( domainfw.log privatefw.log publicfw.log ) for better organization and identification of specific issues within each profile.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to %SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\domainfw.log :

Firewall\Enable Domain Network Firewall: Log File Path

Impact:

The log file will be stored in the specified file.

This service manages persistent subscriptions to events from remote sources that support WS-Management protocol. This includes Windows Vista event logs, hardware and IPMI-enabled event sources. The service stores forwarded events in a local Event Log.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In a high security environment, remote connections to secure workstations should be minimized, and management functions should be done locally.

Solution:

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

The configuration of proper time synchronization is critically important in an enterprise managed environment both due to the sensitivity of Kerberos authentication timestamps and also to ensure accurate security logging. This should be done through a known NTP server. Member servers and workstations should not typically be time sources for other clients.

This policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user's logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Note: A Windows 10, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Auditing\Account Logon Logoff Audit Group Membership

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This setting configures the server-side processing of the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) protocol.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.

More information on this can be found at the following links:

Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft

Disable SMB v1 in Managed Environments with Group Policy - 'Stay Safe' Cyber Security Blog

Disabling SMBv1 through Group Policy - Microsoft Security Guidance blog

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\MS Security Guide\Configure SMB v1 server

Impact:

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with the vendor of the incompatible system. Microsoft is also maintaining a thorough (although not comprehensive) list of known SMBv1 incompatibilities at this link:

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: True

Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No it's recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No Otherwise, users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

Firewall notifications can be complex and may confuse the end users, who would not be able to address the alert.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to True :

In Windows 2003 and older versions of Windows, the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator service manages the RPC name service database. In Windows Vista or newer versions of Windows, this service does not provide any functionality and is present for application compatibility.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

This is a legacy service that has no value or purpose other than application compatibility for very old software. It should be disabled unless there is a specific old application still in use on the system that requires it.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureRemoteProcedureCallLocatorServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name RpcLocator -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

No impact, unless an old, legacy application requires it.

This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide elevated rights to access sensitive data.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not assign any user accounts this right.

The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to create or modify tokens can change the level of access for any currently logged on account. They could escalate their own privileges or create a DoS condition.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which equals No One

User Rights\Create Token

Note: Using (<![CDATA[]]>) to represent a blank value or No One is recommended by Microsoft. However, there is a known issue where an error occurs in Endpoint Manger (Intune) but does not affect the policy setting from being applied to the system properly.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

Use this option to specify the path and name of the file in which Windows Firewall will write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is: %SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\publicfw.log

If Windows Firewall events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible for Administrators to analyze system issues or unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Microsoft stores all firewall events as one file on the system ( pfirewall.log ). To improve logging, separate each firewall profile (domain, private, public) into its own distinct log file ( domainfw.log privatefw.log publicfw.log ) for better organization and identification of specific issues within each profile.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to %SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\publicfw.log :

This policy settings configures post-authentication actions which will be executed after detecting an authentication by the Windows LAPS managed account. The Grace period refers to the amount of time (hours) to wait after an authentication before executing the specified post-authentication actions.

The recommended state for this setting is: Configured: 8 or fewer hours, but not 0

Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Note #3: If this policy is set to 0 it prevents all post-authentication actions from occurring.

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration from Microsoft Intune Admin Center:

 - Navigate to Endpoint security > Account protection
 - Create or edit a LAPS policy type Local admin password solution (Windows LAPS)
 - Set Post Authentication Reset Delay to Configured: 8 (or fewer hours, but not 0)

Impact:

After 8 hours, the Windows LAPS managed account password will be reset and log off the system.

This policy setting allows you to configure a time limit for disconnected Remote Desktop Services sessions.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 minute

This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being consumed by large numbers of disconnected but still active sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service. This setting is important to ensure a disconnected session is properly terminated.

In addition, session timeouts that are misconfigured or set for a long period of time can leave the system open to an attacker hijacking the session.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 1 minute

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Session Time Limits\Set time limit for disconnected sessions

Impact:

Disconnected Remote Desktop sessions are deleted from the server after 1 minute. Note that disconnected session time limits do not apply to console sessions.

This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Remote Desktop clients. After the baseline workstation is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to use local accounts to access the workstation from the network. Domain accounts can access the workstation for administration and end-user processing. This user right supersedes the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right if an account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests, Local account

Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) workstation as described above may result in an inability to remotely administer the workstation.

Note: The security identifier Local account is not available in Windows 7 and Windows 8.0 unless

MSKB 2871997

has been installed.

Note #2: In all versions of Windows prior to Windows 7, Remote Desktop Services was known as Terminal Services so you should substitute the older term if comparing against an older OS.

Any account with the right to log on through Remote Desktop Services could be used to log on to the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Guests, Local account

User Rights\Deny Remote Desktop Services Log On

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you assign the Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services user right to other groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. Accounts that have this user right will be unable to connect to the computer through either Remote Desktop Services or Remote Assistance. You should confirm that delegated tasks will not be negatively impacted.

This policy setting allows you to specify whether Remote Desktop Services requires secure Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication with all clients or allows unsecured communication.

You can use this policy setting to strengthen the security of RPC communication with clients by allowing only authenticated and encrypted requests.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Allowing unsecure RPC communication can exposes the server to man in the middle attacks and data disclosure attacks.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Require secure RPC communication

Impact:

Remote Desktop Services accepts requests from RPC clients that support secure requests, and does not allow unsecured communication with untrusted clients.

This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed by clients for applications using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI.

The recommended state for this setting is: Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption

Note: These values are dependent on the

Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level

(Rule 2.3.11.7) security setting value.

You can enable both options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. In other words, these options help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption :

Local Policies Security Options\Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients

Impact:

NTLM connections will fail if NTLMv2 protocol and strong encryption (128-bit) are not both negotiated. Client applications that are enforcing these settings will be unable to communicate with older servers that do not support them.

This policy setting specifies whether Search Companion should automatically download content updates during local and Internet searches.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

There is a small risk that users will unknowingly reveal sensitive information because of the topics they are searching for. This risk is very low because even if this setting is enabled users still must submit search queries to the desired search engine in order to perform searches.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Internet Communication Management\Internet Communication settings\Turn off Search Companion content file updates

Impact:

Search Companion does not download content updates during searches.

Note: Internet searches will still send the search text and information about the search to Microsoft and the chosen search provider. If you select Classic Search, the Search Companion feature will be unavailable. You can select Classic Search by clicking Start, Search, Change Preferences, and then Change Internet Search Behavior.

This policy setting allows users to change the Trusted for Delegation setting on a computer object in Active Directory. Abuse of this privilege could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users on the network.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

Misuse of the Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation user right could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users on the network. An attacker could exploit this privilege to gain access to network resources and make it difficult to determine what has happened after a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which equals No One

User Rights\Enable Delegation

Note: Using (<![CDATA[]]>) to represent a blank value or No One is recommended by Microsoft. However, there is a known issue where an error occurs in Endpoint Manger (Intune) but does not affect the policy setting from being applied to the system properly.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

Service supporting the audio gateway role of the Bluetooth Handsfree Profile.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Bluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard. Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not being able to use Bluetooth devices.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name BTAGService -StartupType Disabled

Note: This service was first introduced in Windows 10 Release 1803. It appears to have replaced the older

Bluetooth Handsfree Service (BthHFSrv)

, which was removed from Windows in that release (it is not simply a rename, but a different service).

Impact:

Bluetooth hands-free devices will not function properly with the computer.

This policy setting turns off the connection between Windows and the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS). This policy setting also stops applications from being able to poll application services to update tiles.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) is a mechanism to receive third-party notifications and updates from the cloud/Internet. In a high security environment, external systems, especially those hosted outside the organization, should be prevented from having an impact on the secure workstations.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 1 :

This policy setting prevents computers from connecting to both a domain based network and a non-domain based network at the same time.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

The potential concern is that a user would unknowingly allow network traffic to flow between the insecure public network and the enterprise managed network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Network\Windows Connection Manager\Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network

Impact:

The computer responds to automatic and manual network connection attempts based on the following circumstances:

Automatic connection attempts

- When the computer is already connected to a domain based network, all automatic connection attempts to non-domain networks are blocked. - When the computer is already connected to a non-domain based network, automatic connection attempts to domain based networks are blocked.

Manual connection attempts

- When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain based network over media other than Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing network connection is disconnected and the manual connection is allowed. - When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain based network over Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing Ethernet connection is maintained and the manual connection attempt is blocked.

This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash. Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.

Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of attacks will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more difficult for these types of attacks to succeed.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior. Earlier operating systems such as Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME as well as some third-party applications will fail.

This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop Services allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Always prompt for password upon connection

Impact:

Users cannot automatically log on to Remote Desktop Services by supplying their passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. They will be prompted for a password to log on.

This setting controls the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data segment (non-connect segment) before the connection is aborted. The retransmission time-out is doubled with each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset when responses resume. The base time-out value is dynamically determined by the measured round-trip time on the connection.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3

A malicious user could exhaust a target computer's resources if it never sent any acknowledgment messages for data that was transmitted by the target computer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 3

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS:(TcpMaxDataRetransmissions) How many times unacknowledged data is retransmitted

Impact:

TCP starts a retransmission timer when each outbound segment is passed to the IP. If no acknowledgment is received for the data in a given segment before the timer expires, then the segment is retransmitted up to three times.

This policy is intended to provide additional security against external DMA-capable devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA-capable devices that are not compatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block All

Note : This policy does not apply to 1394, PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices. The protection also only applies to Windows 10 R1803 or higher and requires a UEFI BIOS to function.

Note #2 : More information on this feature is available at this link:

Kernel DMA Protection for Thunderbolt 3 (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

.

Device memory sandboxing allows the OS to leverage the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) of a device to block unpermitted I/O, or memory access, by the peripheral.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following

Custom

profile path to Enabled: Block All :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URL: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/DmaGuard/DeviceEnumerationPolicy
Data Type: Integer
Value: 0

Impact:

External devices that are not compatible with DMA-remapping will not be enumerated and will not function unless/until the user has logged in successfully

and

has an unlocked user session. Once enumerated, these devices will continue to function, regardless of the state of the session. Devices that are compatible with DMA-remapping will be enumerated immediately, with their device memory isolated.

This policy setting controls whether computers will show a warning and a security elevation prompt when users create a new printer connection using Point and Print.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Show warning and elevation prompt

Note: On August 10, 2021, Microsoft announced a Point and Print Default Behavior Change which modifies the default Point and Print driver installation and update behavior to require Administrator privileges. This is documented in KB5005652 - Manage new Point and Print default driver installation behavior (CVE-2021-34481). This change overrides all Point and Print Group Policy settings and ensures that only Administrators can install printer drivers from a print server using Point and Print. Enabling Windows User Account Control (UAC) for the installation of new print drivers can help mitigate the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) and other Print Spooler attacks.

Although the Point and Print default driver installation behavior overrides this setting, it is important to configure this as a backstop in the event that behavior is reversed.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Show warning and elevation prompt

Administrative Templates\Printers\Point and Print Restrictions: When installing drivers for a new connection

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
 - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
 - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
 - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
 - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
 - 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
 - 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
 - 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
 - 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.
 - 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
 - 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\System Audit I Psec Driver

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

Windows includes a grace period between when the screen saver is launched and when the console is actually locked automatically when screen saver locking is enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 5 or fewer seconds

The default grace period that is allowed for user movement before the screen saver lock takes effect is five seconds. If you leave the default grace period configuration, your computer is vulnerable to a potential attack from someone who could approach the console and attempt to log on to the computer before the lock takes effect. An entry to the registry can be made to adjust the length of the grace period.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 5 or fewer seconds

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be

required

at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

Note #2: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not allow startup key and PIN with TPM

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Do not allow startup key and PIN with TPM

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require additional authentication at startup: Configure TPM startup key and PIN:

Impact:

A TPM, PIN

and

startup key will not be a permitted combination for BitLocker authentication. A PIN requires physical presence to restart the computer. This functionality is not compatible with Wake on LAN solutions.

Use this option to specify the path and name of the file in which Windows Firewall will write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is: %SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log

If Windows Firewall events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible for Administrators to analyze system issues or unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Microsoft stores all firewall events as one file on the system ( pfirewall.log ). To improve logging, separate each firewall profile (domain, private, public) into its own distinct log file ( domainfw.log privatefw.log publicfw.log ) for better organization and identification of specific issues within each profile.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to %SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log :

SSH protocol based service to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but it is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

OpenSSH Server

).

Hosting an SSH server from a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased.

Note: This security concern applies to

any

SSH server application installed on a workstation, not just the one supplied with Windows.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The workstation will not be permitted to be a SSH host server.

This subcategory reports each event of user account management, such as when a user account is created, changed, or deleted; a user account is renamed, disabled, or enabled; or a password is set or changed. If you enable this Audit policy setting, administrators can track events to detect malicious, accidental, and authorized creation of user accounts. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4720: A user account was created.
 - 4722: A user account was enabled.
 - 4723: An attempt was made to change an account's password.
 - 4724: An attempt was made to reset an account's password.
 - 4725: A user account was disabled.
 - 4726: A user account was deleted.
 - 4738: A user account was changed.
 - 4740: A user account was locked out.
 - 4765: SID History was added to an account.
 - 4766: An attempt to add SID History to an account failed.
 - 4767: A user account was unlocked.
 - 4780: The ACL was set on accounts which are members of administrators groups.
 - 4781: The name of an account was changed:
 - 4794: An attempt was made to set the Directory Services Restore Mode.
 - 5376: Credential Manager credentials were backed up.
 - 5377: Credential Manager credentials were restored from a backup.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Audit User Account Management

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting configures the Windows LAPS Password Settings policy for password length.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as '!' or '@'. Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Configured: 15 or more

Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration from Microsoft Intune Admin Center:

 - Navigate to Endpoint security > Account protection
 - Create or edit a LAPS policy type Local admin password solution (Windows LAPS)
 - Set Password Length to Configured: 15 (or more)

Impact:

Windows LAPS-generated passwords will be required to have a length of 15 characters (or more, if selected).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In a high security environment, Remote Desktop access is an increased security risk. For these environments, only local console access should be permitted.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

This policy controls whether a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is required to provision Windows Hello for Business.

 - If you enable this policy setting, only devices with a usable TPM provision Windows Hello for Business.
 - If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the TPM is still preferred, but all devices provision Windows Hello for Business using software if the TPM is non-functional or unavailable.

The recommended state for this setting is: true

Windows Hello for Business utilizes key-based or certificate-based authentication and makes credential theft extremely difficult.

When backed with a TPM chip multiple physical security mechanisms are added in order to make it tamper resistant.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to true :

Windows Hello For Business\Require Security Device

Impact:

If the TPM chip unexpectedly fails the user would be unable to authenticate using their PIN but would still be able to sign-in with their EntraID account password.

This policy setting configures secure access to UNC paths.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled, with 'Require Mutual Authentication' and 'Require Integrity' set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares

Note: If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer systems, then the ' Require Privacy ' setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB encryption. However, using SMB encryption will render the targeted share paths completely inaccessible by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and thorough testing.

Note #2: If the environment is 100% managed by Intune these shares will not be available. An exception to this recommendation will be needed.

In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the

MS15-011

/

MSKB 3000483

security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template ( NetworkProvider.admx/adml ) was also provided with the security update.

Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:

\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

\\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths.

Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here:

Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled with the following paths configured, at a minimum:

\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 \\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

Administrative Templates\Network\Network Provider\Hardened UNC Paths

Impact:

Windows only allows access to the specified UNC paths after fulfilling additional security requirements.

This service supports the Windows.Networking.XboxLive application programming interface.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Xbox Live is a gaming service and has no place in an enterprise managed environment (perhaps unless it is a gaming company).

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

System Services\Xbox Live Networking Service

Impact:

Connections to Xbox Live may fail and applications that interact with that service may also fail.

Manages Internet SCSI (iSCSI) sessions from this computer to remote target devices.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

This service is critically necessary in order to directly attach to an iSCSI device. However, iSCSI itself uses a very weak authentication protocol (CHAP), which means that the passwords for iSCSI communication are easily exposed, unless all of the traffic is isolated and/or encrypted using another technology like IPsec. This service is generally more appropriate for servers in a controlled environment then on workstations requiring high security.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name MSiSCSI -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The computer will not be able to directly login to or access iSCSI targets.

Supports the following TCP/IP services: Character Generator, Daytime, Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

Simple TCPIP services (i.e. echo, daytime etc)

).

The Simple TCP/IP Services have very little purpose in a modern enterprise environment - allowing them might increase exposure and risk for attack.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureSimpleTCPIPServicesStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name simptcp -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The Simple TCP/IP services (Character Generator, Daytime, Discard, Echo and Quote of the Day) will not be available.

This policy setting allows you to configure the amount of functionality that the shell protocol can have. When using the full functionality of this protocol, applications can open folders and launch files. The protected mode reduces the functionality of this protocol allowing applications to only open a limited set of folders. Applications are not able to open files with this protocol when it is in the protected mode. It is recommended to leave this protocol in the protected mode to increase the security of Windows.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Limiting the opening of files and folders to a limited set reduces the attack surface of the system.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\File Explorer\Turn off shell protocol protected mode

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting determines whether cloud consumer account state content is allowed in all Windows experiences.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

The use of consumer accounts in an enterprise managed environment is not good security practice as it could lead to possible data leakage.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Experience\Disable Consumer Account State Content

Impact:

Users will not be able to use Microsoft consumer accounts on the system, and associated Windows experiences will instead present default fallback content.

Allows errors to be reported when programs stop working or responding and allows existing solutions to be delivered. Also allows logs to be generated for diagnostic and repair services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error should be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no benefit to the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some risk of unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

The recommended state for this setting is: False

Note: When the Allow Local Policy Merge setting is configured to False it's recommended to also configure the Disable Inbound Notifications setting to True Otherwise, users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

When in the Public profile, there should be no special local firewall exceptions per computer. These settings should be managed by a centralized policy.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to False :

Impact:

Administrators can still create firewall rules, but the rules will not be applied.

This subcategory reports changes in security state of the system, such as when the security subsystem starts and stops. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4608: Windows is starting up.
 - 4609: Windows is shutting down.
 - 4616: The system time was changed.
 - 4621: Administrator recovered system from CrashOnAuditFail. Users who are not administrators will now be allowed to log on. Some audit-able activity might not have been recorded.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Auditing\System Audit Security State Change

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be

required

at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Require startup PIN with TPM

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Require startup PIN with TPM

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require additional authentication at startup: Configure TPM startup PIN:

Impact:

A startup PIN will be required in addition to a TPM for BitLocker authentication. A PIN requires physical presence to restart the computer. This functionality is not compatible with Wake on LAN solutions.

Note: Although Microsoft '

Deprecated

' Windows Authorization Manager (AzMan) in Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, this feature still exists in the OS (unimproved), and therefore should still be audited.

Auditing events in this category may be useful when investigating an incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Account Management Audit Application Group Management

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This service monitors the current location of the system and manages geofences (a geographical location with associated events).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

This setting affects the location feature (e.g. GPS or other location tracking). From a security perspective, it's not a good idea to reveal your location to software in most cases, but there are legitimate uses, such as mapping software. However, they should not be used in high security environments.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

The LXSS Manager service supports running native ELF binaries. The service provides the infrastructure necessary for ELF binaries to run on Windows.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

Windows Subsystem for Linux

).

The Linux Subsystem (LXSS) Manager allows full system access to Linux applications on Windows, including the file system. While this can certainly have some functionality and performance benefits for running those applications, it also creates new security risks in the event that a hacker injects malicious code into a Linux application. For best security, it is preferred to run Linux applications on Linux, and Windows applications on Windows.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureLxssManagerServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name LxssManager -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The Linux Subsystem will not be available, and native ELF binaries will no longer run.

Note: If your organization has made an exception to this recommendation and is using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) (SharedAccess) service will need to be Enabled for WSL to function. For more information, please visit the following Microsoft Blog:

This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed by servers for applications using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI.

The recommended state for this setting is: Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption

Note: These values are dependent on the

Network security: LAN Manager Authentication Level

(Rule 2.3.11.7) security setting value.

You can enable all of the options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. That is, these options help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption :

Local Policies Security Options\Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) servers

Impact:

NTLM connections will fail if NTLMv2 protocol and strong encryption (128-bit) are not both negotiated. Server applications that are enforcing these settings will be unable to communicate with older servers that do not support them.

This policy setting determines whether Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warns users if they reuse their work or school password.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: This setting only applies to Microsoft Accounts (computer or browser login) while using Microsoft Windows 11 and not on prem domain-joined accounts.

Users will be alerted if they try to use a password that has been exposed in a known data breach. This can help reduce the risk of password-related security incidents, such as unauthorized access to online accounts, and can encourage users to choose strong and unique passwords.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Smart Screen\Enhanced Phishing Protection\Notify Password Reuse

Impact:

Password reuse may be detected as a false positive by Microsoft.

This policy setting allows local users to be enumerated on domain-joined computers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as guessing passwords or social engineering. The value of this countermeasure is small because a user with domain credentials could gather the same account information using other methods.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\System\Logon\Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

 - 5632: A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.
 - 5633: A request was made to authenticate to a wired network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Note: There are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shared folders. If this policy setting is enabled, access to all shared folders on the system is audited.

In an enterprise managed environment, workstations should have limited file sharing activity, as file servers would normally handle the overall burden of file sharing activities.

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting determines whether the SMB client will attempt to negotiate SMB packet signing.

Note: Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details:

Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled

This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers.

This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a Domain Controller.

A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.

-- ' None ' allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.

-- ' Authenticated ' allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.

-- ' Authenticated without exceptions ' allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause serious problems and is not recommended.

Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.

This policy setting allows users to change the size of the pagefile. By making the pagefile extremely large or extremely small, an attacker could easily affect the performance of a compromised computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Users who can change the page file size could make it extremely small or move the file to a highly fragmented storage volume, which could cause reduced computer performance.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Create Page File

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This subcategory reports on violations of integrity of the security subsystem. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4612 : Internal resources allocated for the queuing of audit messages have been exhausted, leading to the loss of some audits.
 - 4615 : Invalid use of LPC port.
 - 4618 : A monitored security event pattern has occurred.
 - 4816 : RPC detected an integrity violation while decrypting an incoming message.
 - 5038 : Code integrity determined that the image hash of a file is not valid. The file could be corrupt due to unauthorized modification or the invalid hash could indicate a potential disk device error.
 - 5056: A cryptographic self test was performed.
 - 5057: A cryptographic primitive operation failed.
 - 5060: Verification operation failed.
 - 5061: Cryptographic operation.
 - 5062: A kernel-mode cryptographic self test was performed.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\System Audit System Integrity

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be

required

at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not allow TPM

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Do not allow TPM

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require additional authentication at startup: Configure TPM startup:

Impact:

A TPM alone will be insufficient authentication for use with BitLocker.

This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts

Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts :

Impact:

Users will not be able to log onto the computer with their Microsoft account.

This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing with clients that request it. If no signing request comes from the client, a connection will be allowed without a signature if the Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled.

Note: Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)

Impact:

The Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated.

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details:

Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled

This policy setting allows a process to assume the identity of any user and thus gain access to the resources that the user is authorized to access.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

The Act as part of the operating system user right is extremely powerful. Anyone with this user right can take complete control of the computer and erase evidence of their activities.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which equals No One

User Rights\Act As Part Of The Operating System

Note: Using (<![CDATA[]]>) to represent a blank value or No One is recommended by Microsoft. However, there is a known issue where an error occurs in Endpoint Manger (Intune) but does not affect the policy setting from being applied to the system properly.

Impact:

There should be little or no impact because the Act as part of the operating system user right is rarely needed by any accounts other than the Local System account, which implicitly has this right.

Provides identity services for the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) and Peer-to-Peer Grouping services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Peer Name Resolution Protocol is a distributed and (mostly) serverless way to handle name resolution of clients with each other. In a high security environment, it is more secure to rely on centralized name resolution methods maintained by authorized staff.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name p2pimsvc -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) and Peer-to-Peer Grouping services may not function, and some applications, such as HomeGroup and Remote Assistance, may not function correctly.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The 'Allow data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: True

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered: Allow data recovery agent

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This setting is used to enable or disable the Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP), which allows the system to detect and configure default gateway addresses automatically as described in RFC 1256 on a per-interface basis.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

An attacker who has gained control of a computer on the same network segment could configure a computer on the network to impersonate a router. Other computers with IRDP enabled would then attempt to route their traffic through the already compromised computer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (PerformRouterDiscovery) Allow IRDP to detect and configure Default Gateway addresses (could lead to DoS)

Impact:

Windows will not automatically detect and configure default gateway addresses on the computer.

IP source routing is a mechanism that allows the sender to determine the IP route that a datagram should take through the network. It is recommended to configure this setting to Not Defined for enterprise environments and to Highest Protection for high security environments to completely disable source routing.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled

An attacker could use source routed packets to obscure their identity and location. Source routing allows a computer that sends a packet to specify the route that the packet takes.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)

Impact:

All incoming source routed packets will be dropped.

This subcategory reports when a user account or service uses a sensitive privilege. A sensitive privilege includes the following user rights:

 - Act as part of the operating system
 - Back up files and directories
 - Create a token object
 - Debug programs
 - Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation
 - Generate security audits
 - Impersonate a client after authentication
 - Load and unload device drivers
 - Manage auditing and security log
 - Modify firmware environment values
 - Replace a process-level token
 - Restore files and directories
 - Take ownership of files or other objects

Auditing this subcategory will create a high volume of events. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4672: Special privileges assigned to new logon.
 - 4673: A privileged service was called.
 - 4674: An operation was attempted on a privileged object.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Privilege Use Audit Sensitive Privilege Use

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting controls whether the computer can download print driver packages over HTTP. To set up HTTP printing, printer drivers that are not available in the standard operating system installation might need to be downloaded over HTTP.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Users might download drivers that include malicious code.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Internet Communication Management\Internet Communication settings\Turn off downloading of print drivers over HTTP

Impact:

Print drivers cannot be downloaded over HTTP.

Note: This policy setting does not prevent the client computer from printing to printers on the intranet or the Internet over HTTP. It only prohibits downloading drivers that are not already installed locally.

This policy setting configures the Windows LAPS Password Settings policy for password length.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as '!' or '@'. Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Configured: 30 or fewer

Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration from Microsoft Intune Admin Center:

 - Navigate to Endpoint security > Account protection
 - Create or edit a LAPS policy type Local admin password solution (Windows LAPS)
 - Set Password Age Days to Configured: 30 (or fewer)

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior, unless set to fewer than 30 days.

This policy setting controls whether the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service can automatically use an authenticated proxy to send data back to Microsoft.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable Authenticated Proxy usage

Sending any data to a third-party vendor is a security concern and should only be done on an as needed basis.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 1 :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/System/DisableEnterpriseAuthProxy
Data type: Integer
Value: 1

Impact:

The Connected User Experience and Telemetry service will be blocked from automatically using an authenticated proxy.

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes them.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Features that enable inbound network connections increase the attack surface. In a high security environment, management of secure workstations should be handled locally.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name WinRM -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The ability to remotely manage the system with WinRM will be lost.

Note: Many remote administration tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), may require the WinRM service to be operational for remote management.

 - 4866: A trusted forest information entry was removed.
 - 4867: A trusted forest information entry was modified.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Auditing\Audit Authentication Policy Change

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting specifies whether to prevent the redirection of data to client LPT ports during a Remote Desktop Services session.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack surface. The need for LPT port redirection within a Remote Desktop session is very rare, so makes sense to reduce the number of unexpected avenues for data exfiltration and/or malicious code transfer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

This policy setting configures whether BitLocker protection is required for a computer to be able to write data to a removable data drive.

All removable data drives that are not BitLocker-protected will be mounted as read-only. If the drive is protected by BitLocker, it will be mounted with read and write access.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Users may not voluntarily encrypt removable drives prior to saving important data to the drive.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Removable Data Drives\Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker

Impact:

All removable data drives that are not BitLocker-protected will be mounted as read-only. If the drive is protected by BitLocker, it will be mounted with read and write access.

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: True (checked)

Note: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (or newer), there is a new control named

Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection

available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those systems.

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:

Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled and check the Also apply to matching devices that are already installed. button.

Administrative Templates\System\Device Installation\Device Installation Restrictions\Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs

Impact:

Existing devices (that match the device IDs specified) that were previously installed prior to the hardening will be disabled or removed.

This policy setting changes the operational behavior of the Responder network protocol driver.

The Responder allows a computer to participate in Link Layer Topology Discovery requests so that it can be discovered and located on the network. It also allows a computer to participate in Quality-of-Service activities such as bandwidth estimation and network health analysis.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

To help protect from potentially discovering and connecting to unauthorized devices, this setting should be disabled to prevent responding to network traffic for network topology discovery.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\Network\Link-Layer Topology Discovery\Turn on Responder

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new system components will need it.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Debug Programs

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical circumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU.

The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs user right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.

Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that they did not start.

This policy setting allows users to shut down Windows Vista-based or newer computers from remote locations on the network. Anyone who has been assigned this user right can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer unavailable to service user requests. Therefore, it is recommended that only highly trusted administrators be assigned this user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Any user who can shut down a computer could cause a DoS condition to occur. Therefore, this user right should be tightly restricted.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Remote Shutdown

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you remove the Force shutdown from a remote system user right from the Server Operators group you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected.

This policy setting determines whether the SMB redirector will send plaintext passwords during authentication to third-party SMB servers that do not support password encryption.

It is recommended that you disable this policy setting unless there is a strong business case to enable it. If this policy setting is enabled, unencrypted passwords will be allowed across the network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

If you enable this policy setting, the server can transmit passwords in plaintext across the network to other computers that offer SMB services, which is a significant security risk. These other computers may not use any of the SMB security mechanisms that are included with Windows Server 2003.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted password to third-party SMB servers

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

Some very old applications and operating systems such as MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and Windows 95a may not be able to communicate with the servers in your organization by means of the SMB protocol.

Enables the server to administer the IIS metabase. The IIS metabase stores configuration for the SMTP and FTP services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

Internet Information Services

).

Note #2: An organization may choose to selectively grant exceptions to web developers to allow IIS (or another web server) on their workstation, in order for them to locally test &amp; develop web pages. However, the organization should track those machines and ensure the security controls and mitigations are kept up to date, to reduce risk of compromise.

Hosting a website from a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.

Note: This security concern applies to

any

web server application installed on a workstation, not just IIS.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureIISAdminServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name IISADMIN -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

IIS will not function, including Web, SMTP or FTP services.

The 'Do not apply during periodic background processing' option prevents the system from updating affected registry policies in the background while the computer is in use. When background updates are disabled, registry policy changes will not take effect until the next user logon or system restart.

This setting affects all policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder and any other policies that store values in the registry.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: FALSE (unchecked).

Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain registry policy changes are applied more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon or system restart.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to `Disabled.

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\

To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled then set the Do not apply during periodic background processing option to FALSE (unchecked).

Note #2: Organizations that utilize a third--party solution for patching may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation, and instead configure it to Disabled so that the native Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the third--party patching process.

Warning: If option 3 or 4 is not selected, then the ScheduledInstallDay recommendation will not take effect and an exception to that recommendation will be needed.

Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to anything other than 'Turn off automatic updates'.

Windows Update For Business\Allow Auto Update

Impact:

Critical operating system updates and service packs will be installed as necessary.

This policy setting determines whether the account name of the last user to log on to the client computers in your organization will be displayed in each computer's respective Windows logon screen. Enable this policy setting to prevent intruders from collecting account names visually from the screens of desktop or laptop computers in your organization.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Warning: If the

Self Service Password Reset (SSPR)

feature is used in Microsoft Entra ID, an exception to this recommendation is needed as it's known to interfere with SSPR.

An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in

Note: In older versions of Microsoft Windows, this setting was named

Interactive logon: Do not display last user name

, but it was renamed starting with Windows 10 Release 1703.

Impact:

The name of the last user to successfully log on will not be displayed in the Windows logon screen.

This policy setting allows you to configure whether or not enhanced startup PINs are used with BitLocker.

Enhanced startup PINs permit the use of characters including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

A numeric-only PIN provides less entropy than a PIN that is alpha-numeric. When not using enhanced PIN for startup, BitLocker requires the use of the function keys [F1-F10] for PIN entry since the PIN is entered in the pre-OS environment before localization support is available. This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities. The TPM has an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to more effectively mount a brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of the function keys.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Allow enhanced PINs for startup

Impact:

All new BitLocker startup PINs set will be enhanced PINs.

Note: Not all computers enable full keyboard support in the Pre-OS environment. Some keys may not be available. It is recommended this functionality be tested using the computers in your environment prior to it being deployed.

This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model Plus (COM+).

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users

Note: If your organization is using Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)), the (organization-named) Defender for Identity Directory Service Account (DSA), will also need to be granted the same Access from network User Right Assignment. For more information on adding the service account please see

Make sure the DSA is allowed to access computers from the network in Microsoft Defender for Identity | Microsoft Docs

.

Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this computer from the network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will be able to read the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators, Remote Desktop Users

User Rights\Access From Network

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you remove the Access this computer from the network user right on Domain Controllers for all users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network resources. If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to connect to those servers through the network. Successful negotiation of IPsec connections requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore if using IPsec, it is recommended that it be assigned to the Authenticated Users group. If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. It is important to verify that authorized users are assigned this user right for the computers they need to access the network.

Windows notices inactivity of a logon session, and if the amount of inactive time exceeds the inactivity limit, then the screen saver will run, locking the session.

The recommended state for this setting is: 900 or fewer second(s), but not 0

Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine inactivity limit.

If a user forgets to lock their computer when they walk away it's possible that a passerby will hijack it.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to 900 or fewer seconds, but not 0 :

Local Policies Security Options\Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit

Impact:

The screen saver will automatically activate when the computer has been unattended for the amount of time specified. The impact should be minimal since the screen saver is enabled by default.

This setting configures the launch of all apps from the Microsoft Store that came pre-installed or were downloaded.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: This policy setting only applies to Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education editions.

Note #2: The name of this setting and the Enabled/Disabled values are incorrectly worded - logically, the title implies that configuring it to Enabled will disable all apps from the Microsoft Store and configuring it to Disabled will enable all apps from the Microsoft Store. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the GPME help text). This is a logical wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.

The Store service is a retail outlet built into Windows, primarily for consumer use. In an enterprise managed environment the IT department should be managing the installation of all applications to reduce the risk of the installation of vulnerable software.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Microsoft App Store\Disable Store Originated Apps

Impact:

All apps from the Microsoft Store that came pre-installed or were downloaded are prevented from launching. Existing Microsoft Store apps will not be updated. Microsoft Store is disabled.

Use this option to specify the size limit of the file in which Windows Firewall will write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is: 16,384 KB or greater

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to 16,384 KB or greater :

Firewall\Enable Public Network Firewall: Log Max File Size (KB)

Impact:

The log file size will be limited to the specified size, old events will be overwritten by newer ones when the limit is reached.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The 'Allow data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered

Impact:

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of a trusted path.

An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL

Impact:

Users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on to Windows unless they use a smart card for Windows logon. A smart card is a tamper-proof device that stores security information.

The number of complex element types (uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation) required for a strong PIN or password.

When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

 -

Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters

 -

Be at least six characters in length

 -

Contain characters from three of the following categories:

 -

English uppercase characters (A through Z)

 -

English lowercase characters (a through z)

 -

Base 10 digits (0 through 9)

The recommended state for this setting is: Digits lowercase letters and uppercase letters are required.

Note: The enforcement of policies for Microsoft accounts happens on the server, and the server requires a password length of 8 and a complexity of 2. A complexity value of 3 or 4 is unsupported and setting this value on the server makes Microsoft accounts non-compliant.

Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with several publicly available tools.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Digits lowercase letters and uppercase letters are required :

Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Alphanumeric Device Password Required: Min Device Password Complex Characters

Note: As of January 30 2024 this setting is nested under Alphanumeric Device Password Required and may not fully appear in Settings Catalog unless unchecked and re-checked in the settings picker.

Impact:

If an organization is using Windows Hello for Business the the Device Lock password settings can impact PIN polices if those policies are not first defined elsewhere. Windows will follow the Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs if this key exists: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork\<Tenant-ID>\Device\Policies Otherwise, it will follow Device Lock policies.

This policy setting specifies the text displayed in the title bar of the window that users see when they log on to the system. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization.

Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happens. It may also help to reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the logon process.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to a value that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization:

 - 4704: A user right was assigned.
 - 4705: A user right was removed.
 - 4670: Permissions on an object were changed.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Auditing\Audit Authorization Policy Change

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting controls detection and action for Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA), which are sneaky unwanted application bundlers or their bundled applications, that can deliver adware or malware.

The recommended state for this setting is: PUA Protection on

For more information, see this link:

Block potentially unwanted applications with Microsoft Defender Antivirus | Microsoft Docs

Potentially unwanted applications can increase the risk of your network being infected with malware, cause malware infections to be harder to identify, and can waste IT resources in cleaning up the applications. They should be blocked from installation.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to PUA Protection on :

Defender\PUA Protection

Impact:

Applications that are identified by Microsoft as PUA will be blocked at download and install time.

This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader.

The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation Configuring this setting to Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to the benchmark.

Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Lock Workstation (or, if applicable for your environment, Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session ):

Local Policies Security Options\Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior

Impact:

If you select Lock Workstation the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session.

If you select Force Logoff users are automatically logged off when their smart card is removed.

If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function identically to Lock Workstation

Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email.

This policy setting manages which updates that are received prior to the update being released.

Dev Channel: Ideal for highly technical users. Insiders in the Dev Channel will receive builds from our active development branch that is earliest in a development cycle. These builds are not matched to a specific Windows 10 release.

Beta Channel: Ideal for feature explorers who want to see upcoming Windows 10 features. Your feedback will be especially important here as it will help our engineers ensure key issues are fixed before a major release.

Release Preview Channel (default): Insiders in the Release Preview Channel will have access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the world. These builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where we recommend companies preview and validate upcoming Windows 10 releases before broad deployment within their organization.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disable Preview builds

Note: Preview Build enrollment requires a telemetry level setting of 2 or higher and your domain registered on insider.windows.com. For additional information on Preview Builds, see:

https://aka.ms/wipforbiz

It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready builds.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disable Preview builds

This policy setting allows you to specify whether to require user authentication for remote connections to the RD Session Host server by using Network Level Authentication.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Requiring that user authentication occur earlier in the remote connection process enhances security.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication

Impact:

Only client computers that support Network Level Authentication can connect to the RD Session Host server.

Note: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as Network Level Authentication will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a 'double logon' requirement for each and every new RDP session.

This subcategory reports when a user's account is locked out as a result of too many failed logon attempts. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4625: An account failed to log on.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Failure

Auditing\Account Logon Logoff Audit Account Lockout

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate the accounts in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). If you enable this policy setting, users with anonymous connections will not be able to enumerate domain account user names on the systems in your environment. This policy setting also allows additional restrictions on anonymous connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and use the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks. (Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some form of security information.)

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior. It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client computers that run older versions of the Windows operating system such as Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems when they try to use resources on the server.

Note: If the 'Allow Telemetry' policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.

Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured

or

configure the setting

Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update

(added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:

This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a local user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'passphrase' is a better term than 'password.' In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.

The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s)

Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to 14 or more character(s) :

Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Min Device Password Length

Impact:

Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.

Warning: If an organization is using Windows Hello for Business the the Device Lock password settings can impact PIN polices if those policies are not first defined elsewhere. Windows will follow the Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs if this key exists: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork\<Tenant-ID>\Device\Policies Otherwise, it will follow Device Lock policies.

This benchmark recommends configuring Device Lock policies for Local User accounts and Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs

Note:

Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts

: The out-of-box experience (OOBE) or user desktop auto logon can fail when a device reboots during the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). This failure can occur when certain DeviceLock policies are applied to a device. An exception to this recommendation might be needed is Windows AutoPilot if used.

This service publishes a machine name using the Peer Name Resolution Protocol. Configuration is managed via the netsh context 'p2p pnrp peer'.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Peer Name Resolution Protocol is a distributed and (mostly) serverless way to handle name resolution of clients with each other. In a high security environment, it is more secure to rely on centralized name resolution methods maintained by authorized staff.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name PNRPAutoReg -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Some peer-to-peer and collaborative applications, such as Remote Assistance, may not function.

This value controls how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact by sending a keep-alive packet. If the remote computer is still reachable, it acknowledges the keep-alive packet.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes (recommended)

An attacker who is able to connect to network applications could establish numerous connections to cause a DoS condition.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes (recommended)

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (KeepAliveTime) How often keep-alive packets are sent in milliseconds

Impact:

Keep-alive packets are not sent by default by Windows. However, some applications may configure the TCP stack flag that requests keep-alive packets. For such configurations, you can lower this value from the default setting of two hours to five minutes to disconnect inactive sessions more quickly.

This setting lets users turn on Credential Guard with virtualization-based security to help protect credentials. The 'Enabled with UEFI lock' option ensures that Credential Guard cannot be disabled remotely. In order to disable the feature, you must set the Group Policy to 'Disabled' as well as remove the security functionality from each computer, with a physically present user, in order to clear configuration persisted in UEFI.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled with UEFI lock

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at

Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

The Enabled with UEFI lock option ensures that Credential Guard cannot be disabled remotely.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled with UEFI lock :

Device Guard\Credential Guard

Impact:

Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known to be compatible.

Warning #2: Once this setting is turned on and active, Credential Guard cannot be disabled solely via GPO or any other remote method. After removing the setting from GPO, the features must also be manually disabled

locally at the machine

This policy setting controls whether computers will show a warning and a security elevation prompt when users are updating drivers for an existing connection using Point and Print.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Show warning and elevation prompt

Note: On August 10, 2021, Microsoft announced a Point and Print Default Behavior Change which modifies the default Point and Print driver installation and update behavior to require Administrator privileges. This is documented in KB5005652 - Manage new Point and Print default driver installation behavior (CVE-2021-34481). This change overrides all Point and Print Group Policy settings and ensures that only Administrators can install printer drivers from a print server using Point and Print. Enabling Windows User Account Control (UAC) for updating existing print drivers can help mitigate the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) and other Print Spooler attacks. Although the Point and Print default driver installation behavior overrides this setting, it is important to configure this as a backstop in the event that behavior is reversed.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Show warning and elevation prompt

Administrative Templates\Printers\Point and Print Restrictions: When updating drivers for an existing connection

Impact:

This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system. Secure locations are limited to the following:

 - ...\Program Files\ including subfolders
 - ...\Windows\System32\
 - ...\Program Files (x86)\ including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)

Note: Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the state of this security setting.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with UIAccess rights has the following abilities:

 - To set the foreground window.
 - To drive any application window using SendInput function.
 - To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input, GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput.
 - To set journal hooks.
 - To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: False

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: False

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered: Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored to AD DS for fixed data drives

This policy setting allows you to prevent Windows from retrieving device metadata from the Internet.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: This will not prevent the installation of basic hardware drivers, but does prevent associated third-party utility software from automatically being installed under the context of the SYSTEM account.

Installation of software should be conducted by an authorized system administrator and not a standard user. Allowing automatic third-party software installations under the context of the SYSTEM account has potential for allowing unauthorized access via backdoors or installation software bugs.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Device Installation\Prevent device metadata retrieval from the Internet

Impact:

Standard users without administrator privileges will not be able to install associated third-party utility software for peripheral devices. This may limit the use of advanced features of those devices unless/until an administrator installs the associated utility software for the device.

This policy setting determines whether users can enable the following WLAN settings: 'Connect to suggested open hotspots,' 'Connect to networks shared by my contacts,' and 'Enable paid services'.

 - 'Connect to suggested open hotspots' enables Windows to automatically connect users to open hotspots it knows about by crowdsourcing networks that other people using Windows have connected to.
 - 'Connect to networks shared by my contacts' enables Windows to automatically connect to networks that the user's contacts have shared with them, and enables users on this device to share networks with their contacts.
 - 'Enable paid services' enables Windows to temporarily connect to open hotspots to determine if paid services are available.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: These features are also known by the name '

Wi-Fi Sense

'.

Automatically connecting to an open hotspot or network can introduce the system to a rogue network with malicious intent.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 0 :

You can use this procedure to control a user's ability to install and configure a Network Bridge.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

The Network Bridge setting, if enabled, allows users to create a Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) bridge, enabling them to connect two or more physical network segments together. A Network Bridge thus allows a computer that has connections to two different networks to share data between those networks.

In an enterprise managed environment, where there is a need to control network traffic to only authorized paths, allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases the risk and attack surface from the bridged network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Network\Network Connections\Prohibit installation and configuration of Network Bridge on your DNS domain network

Impact:

Users cannot create or configure a Network Bridge.

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (or newer), there is a new control named

Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection

available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those systems.

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:

Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Device Installation\Device Installation Restrictions\Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs

Impact:

Devices matching the specified device IDs will be prevented from installation.

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be

required

at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

Note #2: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not allow startup key with TPM

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Do not allow startup key with TPM

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require additional authentication at startup: Configure TPM startup key:

Impact:

A TPM and a startup key will not be a permitted combination for BitLocker authentication.

This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password must be used before the user can change it. You can set a value between 1 and 998 days, or you can allow changes immediately by setting the number of days to 0.

The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s))

Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to 1 (or more day(s)):

Device Lock\Minimum Password Age

Impact:

If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next day.

Warning: If an organization is using Windows Hello for Business the the Device Lock password settings can impact PIN polices if those policies are not first defined elsewhere. Windows will follow the Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs if this key exists: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Policies\PassportForWork\<Tenant-ID>\Device\Policies Otherwise, it will follow Device Lock policies.

This benchmark recommends configuring Device Lock policies for Local User accounts and Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs.

Enables Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests to be processed by this computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

).

Features that enable inbound network connections increase the attack surface. In a high security environment, management of secure workstations should be handled locally.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

The Key Management Service (KMS) is a Microsoft license activation method that entails setting up a local server to store the software licenses. The KMS server itself needs to connect to Microsoft to activate the KMS service, but subsequent on-network clients can activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS server instead of connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you opt-out of sending KMS client activation data to Microsoft automatically.

The recommended state for this setting is: Allow

Even though the KMS licensing method does not

require

KMS clients to connect to Microsoft, they still send KMS client activation state data to Microsoft automatically. Preventing this information from being sent can help reduce privacy concerns in high security environments.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Allow :

Licensing\Disallow KMS Client Online AVS Validation

Impact:

The computer is prevented from sending data to Microsoft regarding its KMS client activation state.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects cause the IPv4 stack to plumb host routes. These routes override the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) generated routes.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

This behavior is expected. The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the ICMP redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic will no longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will limit the system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (EnableICMPRedirect) Allow ICMP redirects to override OSPF generated routes

Impact:

When Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is configured as an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR), it does not correctly import connected interface subnet routes. Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF routes. However, the OSPF router cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet routes are imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing paths.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: False

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: True

Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No it's recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No Otherwise, users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

Firewall notifications can be complex and may confuse the end users, who would not be able to address the alert.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to True :

Firewall\Enable Private Network Firewall: Disable Inbound Notifications

Impact:

Windows Firewall will not display a notification when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.

This policy setting allows you to turn on or turn off Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance on this computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must explicitly click the Yes button to allow the expert to remotely control the workstation.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\System\Remote Assistance\Configure Solicited Remote Assistance

Impact:

Users on this computer cannot use e-mail or file transfer to ask someone for help. Also, users cannot use instant messaging programs to allow connections to this computer.

This policy setting configures the Windows LAPS Password Settings policy for password complexity.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as '!' or '@'. Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Large letters + small letters + numbers + special characters

Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration from Microsoft Intune Admin Center:

 - Navigate to Endpoint security > Account protection
 - Create or edit a LAPS policy type Local admin password solution (Windows LAPS)
 - Set Password Complexity to Large letters + small letters + numbers + special characters

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting determines whether Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warns users if they type their work or school password into one of the following malicious scenarios: into a reported phishing site, into a Microsoft login URL with an invalid certificate, or into an application connecting to either a reported phishing site or a Microsoft login URL with an invalid certificate.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: This setting only applies to Microsoft Accounts (computer or browser login) while using Microsoft Windows 11 and not on-prem domain-joined accounts.

Users will receive a pop-up notification if they try to access a website that is being blocked by Windows Defender SmartScreen. This assists users in making informed decisions about why the website is being blocked and whether to continue to it.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Smart Screen\Enhanced Phishing Protection\Notify Malicious

Impact:

In some cases, Windows Defender SmartScreen may block legitimate websites, that have been incorrectly flagged by Microsoft.

Offers routing services to businesses in local area and wide area network environments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

This service's main purpose is to provide Windows router functionality - this is not an appropriate use of workstations in an enterprise managed environment.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureRoutingAndRemoteAccessServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name RemoteAccess -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The computer will not be able to be configured as a Windows router between different connections.

This policy setting determines which users or processes can generate audit records in the Security log.

The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

An attacker could use this capability to create a large number of audited events, which would make it more difficult for a system administrator to locate any illicit activity. Also, if the event log is configured to overwrite events as needed, any evidence of unauthorized activities could be overwritten by a large number of unrelated events.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE

User Rights\Generate security audits

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

On most computers, this is the default configuration and there will be no negative impact. However, if you have installed

Web Server (IIS)

, you will need to allow the IIS application pool(s) to be granted this user right.

This privilege determines which user accounts can modify the integrity label of objects, such as files, registry keys, or processes owned by other users. Processes running under a user account can modify the label of an object owned by that user to a lower level without this privilege.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

By modifying the integrity label of an object owned by another user a malicious user may cause them to execute code at a higher level of privilege than intended.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which equals No One

User Rights\Modify Object Label

Note: Using (<![CDATA[]]>) to represent a blank value or No One is recommended by Microsoft. However, there is a known issue where an error occurs in Endpoint Manger (Intune) but does not affect the policy setting from being applied to the system properly.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting enables/disables the use of desktop screen savers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

If a user forgets to lock their computer when they walk away, it is possible that a passerby will hijack it. Configuring a timed screen saver with password lock will help to protect against these hijacks.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Control Panel\Personalization\Enable screen saver (User)

Impact:

A screen saver runs, provided that the following two conditions hold: First, a valid screen saver on the client is specified through the recommendation

Force specific screen saver

or through Control Panel on the client computer. Second, the recommendation

Screen saver timeout

setting is set to a nonzero value through the setting or through Control Panel.

This policy setting specifies whether to prevent the redirection of data to client COM ports from the remote computer in a Remote Desktop Services session.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack surface. The need for COM port redirection within a Remote Desktop session is very rare, so makes sense to reduce the number of unexpected avenues for data exfiltration and/or malicious code transfer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Device and Resource Redirection\Do not allow COM port redirection

Impact:

Users in a Remote Desktop Services session will not be able to redirect server data to local (client) COM ports.

IP source routing is a mechanism that allows the sender to determine the IP route that a datagram should follow through the network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled

An attacker could use source routed packets to obscure their identity and location. Source routing allows a computer that sends a packet to specify the route that the packet takes.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting IPv6) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)

Impact:

All incoming source routed packets will be dropped.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services', choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: True

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored to AD DS for operating system drives

Impact:

BitLocker recovery information for the operating system drive will be backed up to AD DS. Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes (4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 32,768 or greater

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Event Log Service\Application\Specify the maximum log file size (KB)

Impact:

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

The 'Do not apply during periodic background processing' option prevents the system from updating affected security policies in the background while the computer is in use. When background updates are disabled, updates to security policies will not take effect until the next user logon or system restart.

This setting affects all policy settings that use the built-in security template of Group Policy (e.g. Windows Settings\Security Settings).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: FALSE (unchecked).

Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain security policy changes are applied more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon or system restart.

Solution:

This policy setting prevents users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to Remote Desktop Servers that they access. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree in Windows Explorer in the following format:

\\TSClient\<driveletter>$

If local drives are shared they are left vulnerable to intruders who want to exploit the data that is stored on them.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Data could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's local computer without any direct user interaction. Malicious software already present on a compromised server would have direct and stealthy disk access to the user's local computer during the Remote Desktop session.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Device and Resource Redirection\Do not allow drive redirection

Impact:

Drive redirection will not be possible. In most situations, traditional network drive mapping to file shares (including administrative shares) performed manually by the connected user will serve as a capable substitute to still allow file transfers when needed.

This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate SAM accounts as well as shares. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous users will not be able to enumerate domain account user names and network share names on the systems in your environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and shared resources and use the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks. (Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some form of security information.)

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares

Impact:

It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client computers that run older versions of the Windows operating system such as Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems when they try to use resources on the server. Users who access file and print servers anonymously will be unable to list the shared network resources on those servers; the users will have to authenticate before they can view the lists of shared folders and printers. However, even with this policy setting enabled, anonymous users will have access to resources with permissions that explicitly include the built-in group, ANONYMOUS LOGON

This policy setting manages whether or not Windows is allowed to use standby states when putting the computer in a sleep state.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

System sleep states (S1-S3) keep power to the RAM which may contain secrets, such as the BitLocker volume encryption key. An attacker finding a computer in sleep states (S1-S3) could directly attack the memory of the computer and gain access to the secrets through techniques such as RAM reminisce and direct memory access (DMA).

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\System\Power Management\Sleep Settings\Allow standby states (S1-S3) when sleeping (on battery)

Impact:

Users will not be able to use Sleep (S3) while on battery, which resumes faster than Hibernation (S4).

 - Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).
 - Windows LAPS does not support simultaneous storage of the local admin password in both directory types.
 - If the setting is configured and the managed device is not joined to the configured directory type, the local administrator password will not be managed by Windows LAPS.

Important: An organization wishing to use Active Directory to backup the LAPS password may make an exception for this recommendation. To implement Active Directory backup see the latest on-premises CIS Benchmark for Windows 10/11. When backing up with Active Directory there are 2 additional security controls to be considered in the benchmark which are not available when using Azure AD for backup. These were excluded from the Intune benchmark as they cannot be selected unless Active Directory is selected as the backup location.

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration from Microsoft Intune Admin Center:

 - Navigate to Endpoint security > Account protection
 - Create or edit a LAPS policy of the type Local admin password solution (Windows LAPS)
 - Set Backup Directory to Backup the password to Azure AD only

Impact:

The passwords managed by Windows LAPS will only be retrievable from the configured directory type.

Use this option to log when Windows Firewall with Advanced Security discards an inbound packet for any reason. The log records why and when the packet was dropped. Look for entries with the word DROP in the action column of the log.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enable Logging Of Dropped Packets

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enable Logging Of Dropped Packets :

Firewall\Enable Private Network Firewall: Enable Log Dropped Packets

Impact:

Information about dropped packets will be recorded in the firewall log file.

This policy setting controls the behavior of application installation detection for the computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Some malicious software will attempt to install itself after being given permission to run. For example, malicious software with a trusted application shell. The user may have given permission for the program to run because the program is trusted, but if they are then prompted for installation of an unknown component this provides another way of trapping the software before it can do damage

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation

Impact:

When an application installation package is detected that requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

When enabled, this policy setting restricts anonymous access to only those shares and pipes that are named in the Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously and Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously settings. This policy setting controls null session access to shares on your computers by adding RestrictNullSessAccess with the value 1 in the

registry key. This registry value toggles null session shares on or off to control whether the server service restricts unauthenticated clients' access to named resources.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Null sessions are a weakness that can be exploited through shares (including the default shares) on computers in your environment.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior. If you choose to enable this setting and are supporting Windows NT 4.0 domains, you should check if any of the named pipes are required to maintain trust relationships between the domains, and then add the pipe to the Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously list:

 - COMNAP: SNA session access
 - COMNODE: SNA session access
 - SQL\QUERY: SQL instance access
 - SPOOLSS: Spooler service
 - LLSRPC: License Logging service
 - NETLOGON: Net Logon service
 - LSARPC: LSA access
 - SAMR: Remote access to SAM objects
 - BROWSER: Computer Browser service

Previous to the release of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) these named pipes were allowed anonymous access by default, but with the increased hardening in Windows Server 2003 with SP1 these pipes must be explicitly added if needed.

This setting controls the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data segment (non-connect segment) before the connection is aborted. The retransmission time-out is doubled with each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset when responses resume. The base time-out value is dynamically determined by the measured round-trip time on the connection.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3

A malicious user could exhaust a target computer's resources if it never sent any acknowledgment messages for data that was transmitted by the target computer.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 3

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS:(TcpMaxDataRetransmissions IPv6) How many times unacknowledged data is retransmitted

Impact:

TCP starts a retransmission timer when each outbound segment is passed to the IP. If no acknowledgment is received for the data in a given segment before the timer expires, then the segment is retransmitted up to three times.

This setting configures the start type for the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) client driver service ( MRxSmb10 ), which is recommended to be disabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable driver (recommended)

Note: Do not,

under any circumstances

, configure this overall setting as Disabled as doing so will delete the underlying registry entry altogether, which will cause serious problems.

Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.

More information on this can be found at the following links:

Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft

Disable SMB v1 in Managed Environments with Group Policy - 'Stay Safe' Cyber Security Blog

Disabling SMBv1 through Group Policy - Microsoft Security Guidance blog

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Disable driver (recommended)

Administrative Templates\MS Security Guide\Configure SMB v1 client driver

Impact:

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with the vendor of the incompatible system. Microsoft is also maintaining a thorough (although not comprehensive) list of known SMBv1 incompatibilities at this link:

This policy setting specifies whether the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program can collect anonymous information about how Windows is used.

Microsoft uses information collected through the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program to improve features that are most used and to detect flaws so that they can be corrected more quickly. Enabling this setting will reduce the amount of data Microsoft is able to gather for this purpose. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Large enterprise managed environments may not want to have information collected by Microsoft from managed client computers.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Internet Communication Management\Internet Communication settings\Turn off the Windows Messenger Customer Experience Improvement Program

Impact:

Windows Messenger will not collect usage information, and the user settings to enable the collection of usage information will not be shown.

This policy setting lets you control whether Microsoft accounts are optional for Windows Store apps that require an account to sign in. This policy only affects Windows Store apps that support it.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Enabling this setting allows an organization to use their enterprise user accounts instead of using their Microsoft accounts when accessing Windows store apps. This provides the organization with greater control over relevant credentials. Microsoft accounts cannot be centrally managed and as such enterprise credential security policies cannot be applied to them, which could put any information accessed by using Microsoft accounts at risk.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\App runtime\Allow Microsoft accounts to be optional

Impact:

Windows Store apps that typically require a Microsoft account to sign in will allow users to sign in with an enterprise account instead.

A reliable and accurate account of time is important for a number of services and security requirements, including but not limited to distributed applications, authentication services, multi-user databases and logging services. The use of an NTP client (with secure operation) establishes functional accuracy and is a focal point when reviewing security relevant events.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service\Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Client

Impact:

System time will be synced to the configured NTP server(s).

LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocol. With LLMNR, queries are sent using multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not require a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows the location of the requested system.

Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting, the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP (on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with different NIC hardware installations.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Network\DNS Client\Turn off multicast name resolution

Impact:

In the event DNS is unavailable a system will be unable to request it from other systems on the same subnet.

This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: If logging of

Script Block Invocation Start/Stop Events

is enabled (option box checked), PowerShell will log additional events when invocation of a command, script block, function, or script starts or stops. Enabling this option generates a high volume of event logs. CIS has intentionally chosen not to make a recommendation for this option, since it generates a large volume of events. If an organization chooses to enable the optional setting (checked), this also conforms to the benchmark.

Logs of PowerShell script input can be very valuable when performing forensic investigations of PowerShell attack incidents to determine what occurred.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows PowerShell\Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging

Impact:

PowerShell script input will be logged to the Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel, which can contain credentials and sensitive information.

Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information in the PowerShell logs, which could be exposed to users who have read-access to those logs. Microsoft provides a feature called 'Protected Event Logging' to better secure event log data. For assistance with protecting event logging, visit:

This security setting determines which users are prevented from logging on at the computer. This policy setting supersedes the Allow log on locally policy setting if an account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests

Important: If you apply this security policy to the Everyone group, no one will be able to log on locally.

Warning: The help text in Intune associated with this recommendation is for the setting,

Deny log on as a service

and not this setting.

Any account with the ability to log on locally could be used to log on at the console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Guests

User Rights\Deny Local Log On

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you assign the Deny log on locally user right to additional accounts, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific roles in your environment. However, this user right should explicitly be assigned to the ASPNET account on computers that run IIS 6.0. You should confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected.

This policy setting specifies whether Windows Messenger can collect anonymous information about how the Windows Messenger software and service is used.

Microsoft uses information collected through the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program to detect software flaws so that they can be corrected more quickly, enabling this setting will reduce the amount of data Microsoft is able to gather for this purpose. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Large enterprise managed environments may not want to have information collected by Microsoft from managed client computers.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\System\Internet Communication Management\Internet Communication settings\Turn off Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program

Impact:

All users are opted out of the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program.

This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received.

Defer Updates This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available to your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre-release channels and up to 365 days for the Semi-Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi-Annual Channel, a version for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the device reaches end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the version specified will take precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see the Windows Release Information page for OS version information.

Pause Updates To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled time, you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35 days from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be offered).

Note: If the 'Allow Diagnostic Data' (formerly 'Allow Telemetry') policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.

Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured

or

configure the setting

Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update

(added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:

 -

Demystifying 'Dual Scan' - WSUS Product Team Blog

 -

Improving Dual Scan on 1607 - WSUS Product Team Blog

Note #3: Prior to Windows 10 R1703, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS. Starting with Windows 10 R1703, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days.

In a production environment, it is preferred to only use software and features that are publicly available, after they have gone through rigorous testing in beta.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 180 or more days

Windows Update for Business\Defer Feature Updates Period in Days

Impact:

Feature Updates will be delayed until they are publicly released to general public by Microsoft.

This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the keyboard of the computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes (4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 32,768 or greater

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Event Log Service\System\Specify the maximum log file size (KB)

Impact:

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

Windows Emergency Management Services and Serial Console

).

Allowing the use of a remotely accessible command prompt that provides the ability to perform remote management tasks on a computer is a security risk.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI:
       ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureSpecialAdministrationConsoleHelperServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name sacsvr -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Users will not have access to a remote command prompt using Emergency Management Services.

This policy setting allows you to manage configuration of remote access to all supported shells to execute scripts and commands.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: The GPME help text for this setting is incorrectly worded, implying that configuring it to Enabled will reject new Remote Shell connections, and setting it to Disabled will allow Remote Shell connections. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the title of the setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.

Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Remote Shell\Allow Remote Shell Access

Impact:

New Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the workstation.

This policy setting specifies when computers in your environment will receive security updates from Windows Update or WSUS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Every day

Note: This setting is only applicable if the option of 3 or 4 is selected in the recommendation

'Allow Auto Update'

. It will have no impact if any other option is selected.

Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Every day

Windows Update For Business\Scheduled Install Day

Impact:

If option 3 or 4 is selected in recommendation

'Allow Auto Update'

, critical operating system updates and service packs will automatically download every day (at 3:00 A.M., by default).

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client will not use Digest authentication.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Digest authentication is less robust than other authentication methods available in WinRM, an attacker who is able to capture packets on the network where WinRM is running may be able to determine the credentials used for accessing remote hosts via WinRM.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\WinRM Client\Disallow Digest authentication

Impact:

The WinRM client will not use Digest authentication.

This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all types of access requested. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Note: A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.

Auditing removable storage may be useful when investigating an incident. For example, if an individual is suspected of copying sensitive information onto a USB drive.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Object Access Audit Removable Storage

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client uses Basic authentication.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: Clients that use Microsoft's Exchange Online service (Office 365) will require an exception to this recommendation, to instead have this setting set to Enabled. Exchange Online uses Basic authentication over HTTPS, and so the Exchange Online authentication traffic will still be safely encrypted.

Basic authentication is less robust than other authentication methods available in WinRM because credentials including passwords are transmitted in plain text. An attacker who is able to capture packets on the network where WinRM is running may be able to determine the credentials used for accessing remote hosts via WinRM.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\WinRM Client\Allow Basic authentication

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security (VBS) is enabled. VBS uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Turns on VBS with Secure Boot or Turns on VBS with Secure Boot and direct memory access (DMA). DMA requires hardware support

Note: VBS requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at

Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

Secure Boot can help reduce the risk of bootloader attacks and in conjunction with DMA protections to help protect data from being scraped from memory.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Turns on VBS with Secure Boot or Turns on VBS with Secure Boot and direct memory access (DMA). DMA requires hardware support :

Device Guard\Require Platform Security Features

Impact:

Choosing the Secure Boot option provides the system with as much protection as is supported by the computer's hardware. A system with input/output memory management units (IOMMUs) will have Secure Boot with DMA protection. A system without IOMMUs will simply have Secure Boot enabled without DMA protection.

Choosing the Secure Boot with DMA protection option requires the system to have IOMMUs in order to enable VBS. Without IOMMU hardware support, VBS will be disabled.

Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known to be compatible.

This setting controls whether Windows Media Player is allowed to download additional codecs for decoding media files it does not already understand.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

This has some potential for risk if a malicious data file is opened in Media Player that requires an additional codec to be installed. If a special codec is required for a necessary job function, then that codec should first be tested to ensure it is legitimate, and it should be supplied by the IT department in the organization.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

This Policy setting lets you capture the input and output of Windows PowerShell commands into text-based transcripts.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

PowerShell transcript input can be very valuable when performing forensic investigations of PowerShell attack incidents to determine what occurred.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows PowerShell\Turn on PowerShell Transcription

Impact:

PowerShell transcript input will be logged to the PowerShell_transcript output file, which is saved to the My Documents folder of each users' profile by default.

Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information in the PowerShell_transcript output file, which could be exposed to users who have read-access to the file.

Warning #2: PowerShell Transcription is not compatible with the natively installed PowerShell v4 on Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1511 and Server 2012 R2 and below. If this recommendation is set as prescribed, PowerShell will need to be updated to at least v5.1 or newer. For more information on updating PowerShell, please see

The recommended state for this setting is : Success and Failure

Changes to firewall rules are important for understanding the security state of the computer and how well it is protected against network attacks.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Policy Change Audit MPSSVC Rule Level Policy Change

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identity. This policy is supported on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

The recommended state for this setting is: Allow

When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using SPNEGO (Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if you are connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session. When connecting with a NULL session, a system-generated session key is created, which provides no protection but allows applications to sign and encrypt data without errors. When connecting with the computer identity, both signing and encryption is supported in order to provide data protection.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Allow :

Local Policies Security Options\Network security: Allow Local System to use computer identity for NTLM

Impact:

Services running as Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication will use the computer identity. This might cause some authentication requests between Windows operating systems to fail and log an error.

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of device setup class globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for device drivers that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing or updating device drivers whose device setup class GUIDs appear in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

Here are the four entries we recommend and what they translate to:

 - {d48179be-ec20-11d1-b6b8-00c04fa372a7} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the SBP2 Protocol Class
 - {7ebefbc0-3200-11d2-b4c2-00a0C9697d07} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the IEC-61883 Protocol Class

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:

Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled and add {d48179be-ec20-11d1-b6b8-00c04fa372a7} {7ebefbc0-3200-11d2-b4c2-00a0C9697d07} {c06ff265-ae09-48f0-812c-16753d7cba83} and {6bdd1fc1-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f} to the device setup classes list.

This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions when it installs any program on the system.

Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.

Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled :

Microsoft App Store\MSI Always install with elevated privileges

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

The Bluetooth service supports discovery and association of remote Bluetooth devices.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Bluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard. Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not being able to use Bluetooth devices.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name bthserv -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Already installed Bluetooth devices may fail to operate properly and new devices may be prevented from being discovered or associated. If Bluetooth devices were installed, then some Windows components, such as Devices and Printers, may fail to operate correctly - including hanging/freezing when opened. The solution, besides re-enabling this service, is to disable or delete the offending Bluetooth device(s) in Device Manager, or disable the device altogether via the system BIOS (if it is an on-board Bluetooth device).

This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands are generally stored in autorun.inf files. They often launch the installation program or other routines.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands

Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the system will automatically execute the program without user intervention. This creates a major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is to be run. The autorun command is represented as a handler in the Autoplay dialog.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\AutoPlay Policies\Set the default behavior for AutoRun

Impact:

AutoRun commands will be completely disabled.

This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is automatically disconnected.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not Never (0)

This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being consumed by large numbers of inactive sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service.

In addition, session timeouts that are misconfigured or set for a long period of time can leave the system open to an attacker hijacking the session.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not Never (0)

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Session Time Limits\Set time limit for active but idle Remote Desktop Services sessions

Impact:

Remote Desktop Services will automatically disconnect active but idle sessions after 15 minutes (or the specified amount of time). The user receives a warning two minutes before the session disconnects, which allows the user to press a key or move the mouse to keep the session active. Note that idle session time limits do not apply to console sessions.

This setting determines whether hash values are computed for files scanned by Microsoft Defender.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enable

When running an antivirus solution such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is important to ensure that it is configured to monitor for suspicious and known malicious activity. File hashes are a reliable way of detecting changes to files, and can speed up the scan process by skipping files that have not changed since they were last scanned and determined to be safe. A changed file hash can also be cause for additional scrutiny.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enable

Defender\Enable File Hash Computation

Impact:

This setting could cause performance degradation during initial deployment and for users where new executable content is frequently being created (such as software developers), or where applications are frequently installed or updated.

For more information on this setting, please visit

Security baseline (FINAL): Windows 10 and Windows Server, version 2004 - Microsoft Tech Community - 1543631

This user right is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace. However, components that run in kernel mode have this user right inherently. Therefore, it is typically not necessary to specifically assign this user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

Users who have the Create permanent shared objects user right could create new shared objects and expose sensitive data to the network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which equals No One

This policy settings configures post-authentication actions which will be executed after detecting an authentication by the LAPS managed account. The Action refers to actions to take upon expiry of the grace period before executing the specified post-authentication actions.

Post-authentication actions:

 - Reset password : upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset.
 - Reset the password and logoff the managed account : upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset and any interactive logon sessions using the managed account will terminated.
 - Reset the password and reboot the device : upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset and the managed device will be immediately rebooted.

Warning: After an interactive logon session is terminated, other authenticated sessions using the Windows LAPS managed account may still be active. The only way to ensure that the previous password is no longer in use is to reboot the OS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Reset the password and logoff the managed account or higher.

Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration from Microsoft Intune Admin Center:

 - Navigate to Endpoint security > Account protection
 - Create or edit a LAPS policy type Local admin password solution (Windows LAPS)
 - Set Post Authentication Actions to Reset the password and logoff the managed account (or higher).

Note: Both Reset the password and logoff the managed account and Reset the password and reboot are considered passing states.

Impact:

After the grace period expires, the Windows LAPS managed account password will be reset and logged off the system or the OS will be restarted.

The recommended state for this setting is: Basic or Security

Note: If your organization relies on Windows Update, the minimum recommended setting is Required diagnostic data Because no Windows Update information is collected when diagnostic data is off, important information about update failures is not sent. Microsoft uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the quality of updates.

Note #2: The

If you enable this Audit policy setting, administrators can track events to detect malicious, accidental, and authorized creation of security group accounts. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4727: A security-enabled global group was created.
 - 4728: A member was added to a security-enabled global group.
 - 4729: A member was removed from a security-enabled global group.

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

Detects other Infrared devices that are in range and launches the file transfer application.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Infrared connections can potentially be a source of data compromise - especially via the automatic 'file transfer application' functionality. Enterprise-managed systems should utilize a more secure method of connection than infrared.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureInfraredMonitorServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name irmon -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Infrared file transfers will be prevented from working.

. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer.

Possible options are:

 - (0x0) Disabled (default)
 - (0x1) Basic membership
 - (0x2) Advanced membership

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.

Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or contact you.

For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data submissions altogether.

This policy setting allows you to configure whether you can use BitLocker without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), instead using a password or startup key on a USB flash drive. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: False

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: False

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require additional authentication at startup: Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM

Impact:

A compatible TPM will be required in order to use BitLocker.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: True

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored to AD DS for operating system drives

Impact:

Users will need to be domain connected and the back up of BitLocker recovery information for the operating system drive must succeed in order to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

Enables remote users to view and modify registry settings on this computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In a high security environment, exposing the registry to remote access is an increased security risk.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name RemoteRegistry -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

The registry can be viewed and modified only by users on the computer.

Note: Many remote administration tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), require the Remote Registry service to be operational for remote management. In addition, many vulnerability scanners use this service to access the registry remotely.

This setting enables virtualization based protection of Kernel Mode Code Integrity. When this is enabled, kernel mode memory protections are enforced and the Code Integrity validation path is protected by the Virtualization Based Security feature.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled with UEFI lock

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at

Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

The Enabled with UEFI lock option ensures that Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity cannot be disabled remotely.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled with UEFI lock

Virtualization Based Technology\Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity

Impact:

Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known to be compatible.

Warning #2: Once this setting is turned on and active, Virtualization Based Security cannot be disabled solely via GPO or any other remote method. After removing the setting from GPO, the features must also be manually disabled

locally at the machine

using the steps provided at this link:

Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Warning #3 :

Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts

: This policy requires a reboot to apply. As a result, prompts may appear when modifying user account control (UAC) settings during the Out of the Box Experience (OOBE) using the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). Increased prompts are more likely if the device reboots after policies are applied. To work around this issue, the policies can be targeted to users instead of devices so that they apply later in the process. An exception to this recommendation may be needed if Windows AutoPilot is used.

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: PCI\CC_0C0A

Note: This device ID is for Thunderbolt controllers. The USB Type-C (USB-C) port standard that is now common in many computers, especially laptops, utilizes Thunderbolt technology, and therefore may be affected by this restriction. If your organization needs to use USB-C extensively, you may need to decide, internally, to allow yourselves an exception to this recommendation. However, please ensure that all necessary decision-makers have accepted the increased risk of BitLocker encryption key theft (and therefore data theft) via malicious Thunderbolt devices (when left unattended), by doing so.

Note #2: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (or newer), there is a new control named

Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection

available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those systems.

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445:

Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker

.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled and add PCI\CC_0C0A to the Device IDs list.

Administrative Templates\System\Device Installation\Device Installation Restrictions\Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs

Impact:

Thunderbolt controllers will be prevented from being installed in Windows.

The 'Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed' option updates and reapplies security policies even if the security policies have not changed.

This setting affects all policy settings within the built-in security template of Group Policy (e.g. Windows Settings\Security Settings).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: TRUE (checked).

Setting this option to true (checked) will ensure unauthorized local changes are reverted to match the domain-based Group Policy settings.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled then set the Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed option to TRUE (checked).

Administrative Templates\System\Group Policy\Configure security policy processing

Impact:

Built-in security template settings will be reapplied even if they have not been changed, which may cause Group Policy refreshes to take longer.

Enables serverless peer name resolution over the Internet using the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Peer Name Resolution Protocol is a distributed and (mostly) serverless way to handle name resolution of clients with each other. In a high security environment, it is more secure to rely on centralized name resolution methods maintained by authorized staff.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name PNRPsvc -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Some peer-to-peer and collaborative applications, such as Remote Assistance, may not function.

This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.

The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any network shares with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of data.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Accounts: Guest account status

Impact:

All network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources. If you disable the Guest account and the Network Access: Sharing and Security Model option is set to Guest Only, network logons, such as those performed by the Microsoft Network Server (SMB Service), will fail. This policy setting should have little impact on most organizations because it is the default setting in Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.

This policy setting specifies the download method that Delivery Optimization can use in downloads of Windows Updates, Apps and App updates. The following methods are supported:

 - 0 = HTTP only, no peering.
 - 1 = HTTP blended with peering behind the same NAT.
 - 2 = HTTP blended with peering across a private group. Peering occurs on devices in the same Active Directory Site (if exist) or the same domain by default. When this option is selected, peering will cross NATs. To create a custom group use Group ID in combination with Mode 2.
 - 3 = HTTP blended with Internet Peering.
 - 99 = Simple download mode with no peering. Delivery Optimization downloads using HTTP only and does not attempt to contact the Delivery Optimization cloud services.
 - 100 = Bypass mode. Do not use Delivery Optimization and use BITS instead.

The recommended state for this setting is any value EXCEPT: Enabled: Internet (3)

Note: The default on all SKUs other than Enterprise, Enterprise LTSB or Education is Enabled: Internet (3) so on other SKUs, be sure to set this to a different value.

Due to privacy concerns and security risks, updates should only be downloaded directly from Microsoft, or from a trusted machine on the internal network that received

its

updates from a trusted source and approved by the network administrator.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to any value

other than

HTTP blended with Internet Peering :

Delivery Optimization\DO Download Mode

Impact:

Machines will not be able to download updates from peers on the Internet. If set to Enabled: HTTP only (0) Enabled: Simple (99) or Enabled: Bypass (100) machines will not be able to download updates from other machines on the same LAN.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: True

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered: Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard

Impact:

The ability to manually select recovery options for fixed drives will not be presented to the user in the BitLocker setup wizard.

This subcategory reports changes in audit policy including SACL changes. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4715: The audit policy (SACL) on an object was changed.
 - 4719: System audit policy was changed.
 - 4902: The Per-user audit policy table was created.
 - 4904: An attempt was made to register a security event source.

 - 4908: Special Groups Logon table modified.
 - 4912: Per User Audit Policy was changed.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This policy only applies when you are using native RDP encryption. However, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is not recommended. This policy does not apply to SSL encryption.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: High Level

If Remote Desktop client connections that use low level encryption are allowed, it is more likely that an attacker will be able to decrypt any captured Remote Desktop Services network traffic.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: High Level

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Set client connection encryption level

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This service spools print jobs and handles interaction with printers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

In a high security environment, unnecessary services especially those with known vulnerabilities should be disabled.

Disabling the Print Spooler (Spooler) service mitigates the PrintNightmare vulnerability (

CVE-2021-34527

) and other attacks against the service.

Solution:
Remediation of this service is currently not possible through Settings Catalog or a custom profile OMA-URI. Instead, it can be scripted and deployed through the Intune Scripts or Remediations blade or by other means.

To establish the recommended configuration via PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Users will not be able to print, including printing to files (such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)) which uses the Print Spooler service.

This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators.

The recommended state for this setting is: Prompt for consent on the secure desktop Configuring this setting to Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop also conforms to the benchmark.

One of the risks that the UAC feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. This setting raises awareness to the administrator of elevated privilege operations and permits the administrator to prevent a malicious program from elevating its privilege when the program attempts to do so.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Prompt for consent on the secure desktop or Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop :

Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators

Impact:

When an operation (including execution of a Windows binary) requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to select either Permit or Deny. If the user selects Permit, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege.

Warning:

Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts

: This policy requires a reboot to apply. As a result, prompts may appear when modifying user account control (UAC) settings during the Out of the Box Experience (OOBE) using the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). Increased prompts are more likely if the device reboots after policies are applied. To work around this issue, the policies can be targeted to users instead of devices so that they apply later in the process. An exception to this recommendation may be needed if Windows AutoPilot is used.

Capturing these audit events may be useful for identifying when the Windows Firewall is not performing as expected.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\System Audit Other System Events

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes (4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: 32,768 or greater

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Event Log Service\Setup\Specify the maximum log file size (KB)

Impact:

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:

 - Join a domain
 - Authenticate between Active Directory forests
 - Authenticate to down-level domains
 - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP
 - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain

The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Send LM and NTLMv2 responses only. Refuse LM and NTLM

Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.

The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM &amp; NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to: Send LM and NTLMv2 responses only. Refuse LM and NTLM :

Local Policies Security Options\Network security: LAN Manager authentication level

Impact:

Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.

NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.

An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production environment.

The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\MSS (Legacy)\MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting prevents connected users from being enumerated on domain-joined computers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as guessing passwords or social engineering. The value of this countermeasure is small because a user with domain credentials could gather the same account information using other methods.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

The 'Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed' option updates and reapplies registry policies even if the registry policies have not changed.

This setting affects all registry policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder and any other policies that store values in the registry.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: TRUE (checked).

Setting this option to true (checked) will ensure unauthorized local changes are reverted to match the domain-based Group Policy settings.

Solution:

Administrative Templates\System\Group Policy\Configure registry policy processing

Impact:

Group Policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder (and other policies that store values in the registry) will be reapplied even if they have not been changed, which may cause Group Policy refreshes to take longer.

This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments with information about their zone of origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, local). This requires NTFS in order to function correctly, and will fail without notice on FAT32. By not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed via the 'Unblock' button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such as

Microsoft Sysinternals Streams

.

A file that is downloaded from a computer in the Internet or Restricted Sites zone may be moved to a location that makes it appear safe, like an intranet file share, and executed by an unsuspecting user. The Attachment Manager feature will warn users when opening or executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Allow 256-bit recovery key

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: Allow 256-bit recovery key

This subcategory reports when a user attempts to log on to the system. These events occur on the accessed computer. For interactive logons, the generation of these events occurs on the computer that is logged on to. If a network logon takes place to access a share, these events generate on the computer that hosts the accessed resource. If you configure this setting to No auditing, it is difficult or impossible to determine which user has accessed or attempted to access organization computers. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4624: An account was successfully logged on.
 - 4625: An account failed to log on.
 - 4648: A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.
 - 4675: SIDs were filtered.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Account Logon Logoff Audit Logon

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems. Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.

Enabled: Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 0 This is the default behavior for Windows.

Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1

For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the '

Mitigating Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques

' documents.

For more information about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 951016:

Description of User Account Control and remote restrictions in Windows Vista

.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems. Ensuring this policy is Enabled significantly reduces that risk.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\MS Security Guide\Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting manages whether or not Windows is allowed to use standby states when putting the computer in a sleep state.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

System sleep states (S1-S3) keep power to the RAM which may contain secrets, such as the BitLocker volume encryption key. An attacker finding a computer in sleep states (S1-S3) could directly attack the memory of the computer and gain access to the secrets through techniques such as RAM reminisce and direct memory access (DMA).

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled

Administrative Templates\System\Power Management\Sleep Settings\Allow standby states (S1-S3) when sleeping (plugged in)

Impact:

Users will not be able to use Sleep (S3) while plugged in, which resumes faster than Hibernation (S4).

This policy setting allows users to take ownership of files, folders, registry keys, processes, or threads. This user right bypasses any permissions that are in place to protect objects to give ownership to the specified user.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

Any users with the Take ownership of files or other objects user right can take control of any object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any changes they wish to that object. Such changes could result in exposure of data, corruption of data, or a DoS condition.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Take Ownership

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the Back up files and directories user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer.

Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators

User Rights\Restore files and directories

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

If you remove the Restore files and directories user right from the Backup Operators group and other accounts you could make it impossible for users who have been delegated specific tasks to perform those tasks. You should verify that this change won't negatively affect the ability of your organization's personnel to do their jobs.

The Web Management Service enables remote and delegated management capabilities for administrators to manage for the Web server, sites and applications present on the machine.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed

Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (

Internet Information Services - Web Management Tools - IIS Management Service

).

Remote web administration of IIS on a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 or confirm that the service is Not installed :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureWebManagementServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name WMSvc -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Remote web-based management of IIS will not be available.

When you dial a phonebook or VPN entry in Dial-Up Networking, you can use the 'Save Password' option so that your Dial-Up Networking password is cached and you will not need to enter it on successive dial attempts. For security, administrators may want to prevent users from caching passwords.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

An attacker who steals a mobile user's computer could automatically connect to the organization's network if the Save This Password check box is selected for the dial-up or VPN networking entry used to connect to your organization's network.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server component. Enable this policy setting in a mixed environment to prevent downstream clients from using the workstation as a network server.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled :

Local Policies Security Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)

Impact:

The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to perform SMB packet signing.

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details:

Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled

Provides network access translation, addressing, name resolution and/or intrusion prevention services for a home or small office network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a feature that allows someone to 'share' their Internet connection with other machines on the network - it was designed for home or small office environments where only one machine has Internet access - it effectively turns that machine into an Internet router. This feature causes the bridging of networks and likely bypassing other, more secure pathways. It should not be used on any enterprise-managed system.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Custom Configuration Policy to 4 :

Name: 	 <Enter name>
Description: <Enter Description>
OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/SystemServices/ConfigureInternetConnectionSharingServiceStartupMode
Data Type: Integer
Value: 4

Note: As of January 2024, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's official documentation, using an OMI-URI to configure a Windows Service Startup Mode via a custom profile will lead to an error in Intune. This error will be logged in the local event log as 'The system cannot find the file specified.' Currently, the most reliable method for remediation is through PowerShell.

The recommended configuration can also be established via PowerShell by running the following cmdlet:

Set-Service -Name SharedAccess -StartupType Disabled

Impact:

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) will not be available. Wireless connections using Miracast will also be prevented.

Note: This service is a prerequisite for the

Microsoft Defender Application Guard

feature in Windows 10, so an exception should be made to this recommendation if intending to use Microsoft Defender Application Guard.

Note #2: If your organization is using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) this service is needed for WSL to function, so an exception should be made to this recommendation. For more information, please visit the following Microsoft Blog:

Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers.

Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.

The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:

 - All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.
 - All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
 - All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.
 - The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.

This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE

User Rights\Change System Time

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected.

This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users.

The recommended state for this setting is: Automatically deny elevation requests

One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious programs running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of their activity. This setting raises awareness to the user that a program requires the use of elevated privilege operations and requires that the user be able to supply administrative credentials in order for the program to run.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Automatically deny elevation requests:

Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users

Impact:

When an operation requires elevation of privilege, a configurable access denied error message is displayed. An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose this setting to reduce help desk calls.

Note: With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring privilege elevation (without Administrator rights) is '

This program will not run. This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.

' Some users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program they attempted to run is specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message seems to imply. This message may therefore result in user questions as to why that specific operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to perform the operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or 'Run as Administrator' if it

is

already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.

Note #2: When using third-party remote support tools, this recommendation could prevent Administrators from entering their administrative credentials. In this case, an exception to this recommendation will be needed.

This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions when it installs any program on the system.

Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.

Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Disabled :

Microsoft App Store\MSI Always install with elevated privileges (User)

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

In a high security managed environment, application installations should be managed centrally by IT staff, not by end users.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Push to Install\Turn off Push To Install service

Impact:

Users will not be able to push Apps to this device from the Microsoft Store running on other devices or the web.

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service will allow RunAs credentials to be stored for any plug-ins.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Note: If you enable and then disable this policy setting, any values that were previously configured for RunAsPassword will need to be reset.

Although the ability to store RunAs credentials is a convenient feature it increases the risk of account compromise slightly. For example, if you forget to lock your desktop before leaving it unattended for a few minutes another person could access not only the desktop of your computer but also any hosts you manage via WinRM with cached RunAs credentials.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\WinRM Service\Disallow WinRM from storing RunAs credentials

Impact:

The WinRM service will not allow the RunAsUser or RunAsPassword configuration values to be set for any plug-ins. If a plug-in has already set the RunAsUser and RunAsPassword configuration values, the RunAsPassword configuration value will be erased from the credential store on the computer.

If this setting is later Disabled again, any values that were previously configured for RunAsPassword will need to be reset.

This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the management of task scheduler jobs or COM+ objects.

For scheduler jobs, the following are audited:

 - Job created.
 - Job deleted.
 - Job enabled.
 - Job disabled.
 - Job updated.

For COM+ objects, the following are audited:

 - Catalog object added.
 - Catalog object updated.
 - Catalog object deleted.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

The unexpected creation of scheduled tasks and COM+ objects could potentially be an indication of malicious activity. Since these types of actions are generally low volume, it may be useful to capture them in the audit logs for use during an investigation.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Object Access Audit Other Object Access Events

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Enabled: True

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard

Impact:

The ability to manually select recovery options for the operating drive will not be presented to the user in the BitLocker setup wizard.

To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE

User Rights\Create Global Objects

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This subcategory reports the results of validation tests on credentials submitted for a user account logon request. These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the credentials. For domain accounts, the Domain Controller is authoritative, whereas for local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of the Account Logon events occur in the Security log of the Domain Controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on other computers in the organization when local accounts are used to log on. Events for this subcategory include:

 - 4774: An account was mapped for logon.
 - 4775: An account could not be mapped for logon.
 - 4776: The Domain Controller attempted to validate the credentials for an account.
 - 4777: The Domain Controller failed to validate the credentials for an account.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Success and Failure

Auditing\Account Logon Audit Credential Validation

Impact:

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect - for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes - to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.

Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started.

Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:

 - The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
 - The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token.
 - The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.

An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE

Note: This user right is considered a 'sensitive privilege' for the purposes of auditing.

An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE

User Rights\Impersonate Client

Note: Include only one User or Group per line in the Settings Catalog configuration screen.

Impact:

In most cases this configuration will have no impact. If you have installed

Web Server (IIS)

, you will need to also assign the user right to IIS_IUSRS

This security setting is used by Credential Manager during Backup and Restore. No accounts should have this user right, as it is only assigned to Winlogon. Users' saved credentials might be compromised if this user right is assigned to other entities.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One

If an account is given this right the user of the account may create an application that calls into Credential Manager and is returned the credentials for another user.

Solution:
To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to (<![CDATA[]]>) which represents No One

User Rights\Access Credential Manager As Trusted Caller

Note: Using (<![CDATA[]]>) to represent a blank value or No One is recommended by Microsoft. However, there is a known issue where an error occurs in Endpoint Manger (Intune) but this does not affect the policy setting from being applied properly to the system.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.
